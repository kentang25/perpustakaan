<h2 class="nobreak">I<br>
<small>THE MARTYRDOM OF HUMPHREY</small></h2>
<p class="center">(Reprinted from <i>Little Folks</i> by kind permission)</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT all started because Humphrey and
me generally play together, and
we generally play at torturing games.
Sometimes we let the little ones, Violet
and Ted, come in too, but they spoil
things rather, because Teddy is so tiny
and Violet doesn’t properly enjoy even
the loveliest tortures. We have promised
Mother, though, that we will try not to
be selfish, so we pretend we don’t mind
their playing with us—much.</p>

<p>I generally make up the tortures
because I’m the eldest. My name is
Molly, and I’m the only one that has
to use two figures for their age; I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>ten. Even Humphrey is a good lot
younger than me; he’s only nine, and
people don’t think he’s as old as
that, because he’s very backward. It
isn’t so much that he can’t think of
clever things, but he had an illness
when he was a baby and that makes
lessons harder for him than for other
people, ’specially long division. He
simply can’t do that; if they try and
make him, he sits and cries, and he
has the most peculiar way of crying of
any one I ever saw. He doesn’t make
any noise nor wrinkle up his face, but
the tears come dripping down slowly
with a plop. Sometimes he catches
them in his mouth, but if he doesn’t,
he always licks them up afterwards,
because he says they are good for the
digestion. He is going to be a doctor,
so that makes him have ideas like that.
Once he invented a most beautiful red
ink, only it made holes right through
his copy-book, and you couldn’t use the
same pen twice, so he had to turn it
into a medicine instead.</p>

<p>Though Humphrey can write, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>can’t read yet, and that’s another peculiar
thing, because with most people
it’s the other way. That’s partly why
it’s always me that invents the games.
I read a nice tortury book, and then
tell him about it, and we pretend it
through. We did enjoy <i>The Tower of
London</i>, but the <i>Pirates of Algiers</i> was
almost better.</p>

<p>One day we were having a lovely
time over this; Humphrey had worked
rusty screws into my chest, and had
clamped an iron band with spikes round
my head, and then he was lashing me
with a waxed thong, when all of a
sudden he stopped.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any fun,” he said, “because
by now you must be dead.”</p>

<p>I told him I wasn’t, and that in the
book they lashed the slaves for hours,
and he must go on.</p>

<p>He said, “Well, if I’m the torturer,
I ought to be allowed to choose the
tortures, and I’m a very enervating
torturer.” I don’t know exactly what
he meant, because he’s fond of using
long words that make grown-up people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>laugh, and then getting sulky. But I
<i>was</i> surprised when he went on solemnly,
“Slave, go and put your head in the
meal-barrel.”</p>

<p>Of course he meant that I was really
to do it, because if one is able to do a
thing there’s no use in just pretending
it; but a nice rage Fräulein would
have been in. She’s our governess and
I expect she’d have given me extra
practising for a week. If there’s one
thing I loathe it’s the piano, especially
now that Fräulein comes and sits beside
me. She used to be in the other room,
which is warmer, and just shout out
every now and then, “Zu schnell, ein,
zwei, drei, vier,” so I could read the
book on my lap quite comfortably.
The music sounded just the same, and
you could shut up your knees quickly
if you heard any one coming, but
somehow Fräulein discovered it. Well,
thinking of the extra practising I should
have to do, I said to Humphrey rather
crossly, “You’re really too stupid to
play with.” Then I walked to the
other end of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>I forget if I said that all this happened
one Sunday when Mother and
Father had gone up to town for a lunch
party. (Mother hates being away from
us like that, especially on a Sunday,
but they had to go.) Fräulein had
been getting the little ones ready for
church, but now they came down and
we started almost directly. It was such
a lovely day that we took the short cut
through the woods; I found some wild
roses, quite pink ones, and the paths
were all mossy and quiet. I stopped
wanting to be cross; woods always do
make one feel gooder somehow. It is
all so silent and lovely.</p>

<p>In church it was very nice too. We
had a most splendid sounding psalm,
and “Onward Christian Soldiers,” which
is my favourite hymn, and we didn’t
stay for the sermon. By the time we
got out I was perfectly aching with
goodness; I wanted to go away at once
and bind up wounded soldiers and things
like that.</p>

<p>I was going along planning it all, and
how nobly I’d catch fever from a poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>drummer-boy and lie beautiful in death
with wreaths all around me, when suddenly
I remembered what Mother once
said about people thinking they’d do
great deeds and passing by the duties
that are on their path. So, as Humphrey
was dawdling behind, because he
was cross, I waited for him and asked
him if I should tell him some story.
This doesn’t sound much but really it
was awfully hard, because you don’t
know how horrid Humphrey looks
when he is sulky. Besides, the little
ones are always bothering me to tell
them stories, so I get rather sick of it,
and Mother said that they must give
me a holiday and not even ask me to on
Sundays.</p>

<p>Well, Humphrey was certainly very
nice; he caught hold of my hand.
“Molly,” he said very slowly, and
wagging his head like he always does;
“Molly, it would be a gweat welief
onto my mind to know if Lady
Flowence Gwendoline escaped fwom
the wobber’s cave, but I’m going to
wait till to-mowow.” It’s horrid for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>him not being able to say his “r’s”
properly, when he’s nearly nine and a
quarter, and Ted who is only five can
talk as if he were grown up. Humph
minds so much though, that we pretend
not to notice it. Any way I don’t
believe it’s a bit of good his putting
rubber bands round his tongue, to curl
it to the right shape, like we found him
in bed one night. He’s been happier,
though, since Mother told him we all
had our bundles of affliction to carry,
and that not being able to say his
“r’s” was in his bundle. And if it
were heavy, Mother said, he mustn’t
grumble, but just step out more bravely.
I’m sure, though, it isn’t a bit heavier
than having hair that will get untidy,
and to stand still and not get impatient
while it’s being brushed, is a very
difficult sort of stepping out.</p>

<p>All this time Humphrey had been
squeezing my hand harder and harder,
and now he said, “I’ve thought of a
lovely new torture that I know you’ll
like. I thought of it all myself in
church. It’s cutting off your head and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>tying it onto a wampant horse and then
dancing.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say, because of
course he was thinking of Salome, whom
we’d had the second lesson about, and
Mother doesn’t like us acting things out
of the Bible, but just then we saw a
bush of burs. We always like to have
burs, because they’re so convenient to
put in one another’s hair and down
people’s backs and nice tortury things
of that sort; these, though, grew right
in the middle of a bed of nettles.
“Disagweable things,” said Humphrey.</p>

<p>But when I saw the nettles I remembered
more than ever about the duties on
one’s path, and how I’d promised Mother
to try and be unselfish, and I thought
perhaps this would make up for some
of the times I hadn’t been. Besides,
I thought how astonished Humphrey
would be at my bravery. So I just pretended
that I was the Black Prince scaling
the walls of Calais, and I dashed into the
stinging-nettles. I forgot, though, that
the Prince had got his armour on, and
we’d gone into summer stockings that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>day, at least the other three wear socks,
but, of course, I’m too old. But by
thinking I was Joan of Arc as well, I
got the burs, and when I came out
Humphrey was so astonished, he
couldn’t say anything at all, particularly
when I gave them all to him. I
didn’t keep a single one.</p>

<p>My legs were hurting dreadfully, so
I pulled down my stockings to look,
and there were a lot of great white
lumps; that was rather nice, because
sometimes things are horrid, like
earache, with nothing to show for it
and all waste. So I sent Humphrey
for some dock leaves, but he couldn’t
find any, though when you aren’t
wanting them, you are always seeing
them. He said that if you rubbed on
the milk of dandelions with a dead
mole’s paw, it would do just as well, but
then we hadn’t got a mole, except the
one we are trying to tame on the tennis
lawn, and he isn’t dead.</p>

<p>Poor Humphrey looked quite unhappy
when I told him this. He was
quiet for a long time, and then he said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I’ll go on lashing you with waxed
thongs if you like.” I did think that
nice of him. Generally if we quarrel,
you might cut him up into little bits
before he’d say he was wrong.</p>

<p>So I thanked him but I said it didn’t
matter, because we must hurry home.
On Sundays we have tart for dinner,
and if Mother’s at home there is
generally cream, and even if Fräulein
is stingy about that, I didn’t want to
miss the tart, particularly as I knew that
it was raspberry. I forgot to explain
that if we are late for meals, we don’t
have any pudding, at least at breakfast
or tea it’s jam, unless there is a very
good reason why we couldn’t help it.
I dare say if I’d shown Fräulein my
lumps on my legs she’d have excused
me, but, of course, I wasn’t going to
do that; I should have liked the little
ones to have seen them though before
they went down. They were very large
lumps.</p>

<p>It was when we were going along that
I had the Great Idea. I was thinking
about the tortures, because I knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Humphrey would want to do Salome,
unless I could tell him of something
else. “We’ll be Christian martyrs,”
I said suddenly. “You shall be burnt.”</p>

<p>Humphrey stood still in the middle
of the road with his mouth open, like
he does when he’s pleased. “When?”
he asked at last.</p>

<p>“After dinner,” I said. “Being
Sunday makes it all the better. You
shall be Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper
and tied to a stake and burnt.”</p>

<p>It really is a convenient thing that
Fräulein likes a nap on Sunday; we got
rid of the little ones too because it was
such a very great secret that we thought
Mother wouldn’t mind. Then Humphrey
and I crept silently up to the
orchard; we are allowed there always,
but it seemed to make it nicer to creep.
Humphrey brought his dark lantern,
but you can’t light it because it drops to
pieces, and I believe he was thinking of
Guy Fawkes, but he said I couldn’t be
sure that Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper
didn’t have a lantern too.</p>

<p>Our orchard is a very nice place;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>generally the washing is hung there,
but, of course, there isn’t any out on
Sundays. So we collected a lot of
twigs and things and piled them round
a clothes-prop, and I stuck in all the
burs to prick the martyr’s feet. Then
I poured paraffin over it all. I forgot
to say that I had brought the can up out
of the scullery. When it was all ready
I tied Humphrey to the post with
some of the clothes-line.</p>

<p>He looked lovely, he really did, just
like Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper. I
took off the sailor hat and told him to
shut his eyes and say his prayers, while I
hit him with things—not hard, of course,
that would be horribly mean when he
was all tied up, but just pretence. And
I kept asking him if he would abjure
his faith, because I was Bloody Mary,
but he wouldn’t, and then I hit him
again. Only in the middle he sneezed
and I had to get out his pocket-handkerchief,
which spoilt it rather. I
don’t know what Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper
did if he wanted to blow his
nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Well, after some time Humphrey
said that he was uncomfortable and must
be burnt quick. So I asked him once
more if he’d abjure, and then I said in
awful tones, “Minion, fire the faggots.”</p>

<p>Of course, I had to be the minion
myself, because Humphrey’s hands were
tied. We’d brought up a box of
matches and I struck one; and now
comes the dreadful part. I don’t know
how it happened, for I threw the match
down quite a long way off; it must have
been the paraffin or something, for
suddenly the flame ran along the grass
and it all began really to blaze.</p>

<p>For the first second we were both so
frightened, we didn’t do anything; then
Humphrey screamed. I rushed forward
and tried to pull him out, but I couldn’t,
and I tried to push away the twigs and
things, but they only seemed to burn
more than ever. All this time I was
screaming too in the most curious way
and shaking all over though it was so
hot. I was just going to run and fetch
Mother, because I’d forgotten she was
out to lunch, when suddenly the clothes-prop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>came out of the ground, and
Humphrey stumbled forward. When
he’d got out of the fire he fell down on
his face and wouldn’t speak, so I was
more frightened than ever.</p>

<p>They carried Humphrey down to the
house, for, of course, I went and fetched
Fräulein. He wasn’t crying, he was
quite still, which seemed worse. I
wanted to go for the doctor, but Fräulein
told me I’d done quite enough harm and
I’d better keep out of the way. So I
went up to the box-room and cried.
My only comfort was that my hands
were hurting a lot, because they were
burnt too, though I hadn’t felt it
before. Still I couldn’t pretend to be
Casabianca like Humphrey might have,
I could only think I was a murderer
and going to be hanged, and there
wasn’t much comfort even in that.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long I stopped
there, but I didn’t have any tea nor
supper either, and I cried so that my
face felt quite stiff. At last, as it was
getting dark, Mother came in. She
didn’t see me, but she said my name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>softly; that made me feel dreadful. So
I just sobbed out, “Is he dead like
Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper?”</p>

<p>But suddenly Mother took me up in
her arms. “Oh, no, no, my poor little
girl,” she said. “He isn’t very badly
burnt, he only fainted.” Then she
carried me downstairs, just as if I were
one of the little ones, and when she saw
my hands she quite cried out. She put
oil and cotton-wool on to them, and it
was lovely, and she brought me some
soup and helped me to undress. I felt
much happier.</p>

<p>First of all, though, I went in to see
Humphrey. He was in bed, and he
didn’t look very different. Directly he
saw me, he called out, “Do you know
that you’ve got seven skins? The doctor
told me so; and I’m playing that I’m a
wounded fireman in the hospital, but it’s
no fun without you.”</p>

<p>I don’t think Latimer-Ridley-and-Hooper
could have said anything
nicer.</p>

<small>SAMSON AND DELILAH</small></h2>
<p class="center">(Reprinted from <i>Little Folks</i> by kind permission)</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BOYS with long hair are always
silly, and Lionel was one of the
silliest. I don’t know whether it was
having the curls that had done it, or if
he had been born stupid, but any way
he used to make a most awful fuss if he
knocked himself or cut his finger, and
he liked to have his hands clean, and
cried if you didn’t always play just what
he wanted. Another peculiar thing
about him was that he seemed to enjoy
it, if visitors noticed him or admired his
hair, instead of escaping as any of us
would have done. Fortunately they
don’t pay much attention to us, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>our hair is short. At least mine and
Humphrey’s is, and though Violet’s
has been allowed to grow, it is quite
straight, and an ugly sort of lighty
brown in colour. As for Teddy, he
is only four, so his hair doesn’t
count.</p>

<p>Though I’ve spoken of Lionel here
by his proper name, we didn’t call him
that. It was much too long, and so we
christened him “Macassar Oil,” because
I discovered that the first part of Lionel
written backwards spells oil, and Cousin
Florence does put stuff on his hair. She
didn’t seem a bit pleased though, when
I explained it to her, though I don’t
believe she’d have ever thought of it
for herself. Cousin Florence is Lionel’s
mother, and they’ve always lived in
India, so we children had never seen
them until they came to stay with us.</p>

<p>It was funny, but though we’d never
wanted people to do anything before
but leave us alone, we found that we
didn’t a bit like it always being Lionel
and his curls that every one made such a
fuss over. I don’t mean, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>that Mother was any different, but she
was so busy that she couldn’t attend to
us much, for there was a dinner party
and lots of other things to amuse Cousin
Florence, and cook’s temper is always
awful. Why, some evenings she couldn’t
even come to say good-night to us
and tuck us up, (I mean Mother, not
cook), and that makes everything seem
horrid.</p>

<p>It wasn’t only Lionel that was such a
trial, but Cousin Florence was always
there too. She said she liked to watch
us play, as if we could do anything with
a grown-up person looking on, and just
at that time we were in the middle of a
most exciting game, where Humphrey
was my grandfather and very strict and
nearly starved and beat me to death.
One day we couldn’t stand it any longer,
so Humph and I ran off and left Cousin
Florence and Lionel. We hid all the
afternoon in the cave we’ve discovered,
where you have to sit quite doubled up
because it’s so small and secret, and it
was lovely. But Mother made us promise
not to do it again. She said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Bayard wouldn’t have done it nor any
one like that, because they considered
the laws of hospitality to be most sacred,
and that they showed politeness to a
visitor even if he’d insulted them. So
after that we always played with Lionel,
but underneath Humph and I had
another game all the time, and that
helped us. We pretended that we were
Knights of the Round Table, and that
Lionel was the Unwelcome Guest, who
had to be courteously entreated; we said
“please” and “thank you” to him in
almost every sentence. Really that was
the only game at which Lionel was
much good, for he didn’t seem to understand
pretending at all, so he always had
to act a passing gentleman or some silly
thing of that sort. He couldn’t even
be a regiment of soldiers properly.</p>

<p>Any one would think that things
were bad enough like this, but it was
much worse when Macassar Oil’s grandmother
came to stay too. She wasn’t
any relation of ours really, but she told us
to call her Aunt Arabella, and so we did,
although we didn’t want to. I didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>like her from the first, though I never
guessed that she’d take to watching us
as well as Cousin Florence. But the
most insulting part was that we found
out they did it because they didn’t
like to leave Lionel alone with us.
They said that we were so rough and
would hurt him or something, just
because Humphrey once knocked him
down, and as Lionel is eleven months
older, I’m sure he ought to have been
ashamed not to be able to take care of
himself. Besides that was before Mother
told us about Bayard. Another horrid
thing that Cousin Florence and Aunt
Arabella did, was always to make out
that Lionel had won in races, and if
Fräulein, our governess, was there, she
was just as bad, and they didn’t seem to
think it dreadful when Lionel cheated or
anything, but only said to one another,
in French, how sweet he looked with
his golden hair and things like that.</p>

<p>Well, we tried to bear it and be good—we
really did. It was most unlucky
that just the day when I was feeling
particularly cross with Lionel, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>he’d gone in to lunch with the grown-ups,
and Humph and I were too untidy,
that I happened to see the picture of
Samson in the old scrap-book. I won’t
tell you more about it now, because
you’ll understand better further on, but
it was that picture that put the whole
thing into my head.</p>

<p>I’d better say at once that of course
we knew that what we meant to do was
naughty, though we pretended to ourselves
that it wasn’t; but we really didn’t
know <i>how</i> naughty it was until Mother
told us afterwards. Besides, we didn’t
wait to let ourselves think, which Mother
says is always a mistake, for it was
directly after lunch that it all happened.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve said that in the
afternoon Lionel always went to sleep;
he really does just as if he were a baby,
only on hot days Cousin Florence sometimes
puts a rug and cushions and
things for him in the garden. Then
every one used to leave him, for we
children were only too glad to get away,
and so they didn’t think they need watch
over him any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>That afternoon it was very warm, and
it all went most conveniently. Instead
of going up to the orchard though, as
we generally did when Lionel rested, we
hid in the laurel bushes. Then as soon
as Cousin Florence had gone into the
house I crept out. Lionel was still
awake, and I made him put his head
on my knees. I felt rather mean at
that part, but it couldn’t be helped, for
that’s what Delilah really did, and Lionel
didn’t mind, because he likes any one to
cuddle him, instead of only his mother
like most people. Then I sat quite still
though I got the most awful pins and
needles in my left foot.</p>

<p>At last he went to sleep and I called
“Man, Man,” softly, and Humphrey
came wriggling along the grass, like
we’d planned.</p>

<p>“Shave off the seven locks of Samson’s
head,” I whispered, but then I saw
that Humph had brought father’s razor
because it said “shave,” so I told him
not to be so silly, but to run and fetch
a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Humphrey was very quick, I will say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>that, and Lionel didn’t stir, so the exciting
part could begin. Humph was
the lords of the Philistines now, of
course, and I took the scissors. And
then—it was dreadful I know—I really
cut off Lionel’s curls!</p>

<p>Lionel never woke, and the scissors
went snip, snip, most beautifully. I did
enjoy it, because I thought so hard about
its being Samson and Delilah that I
couldn’t remember it was naughty. At
last the curls were all off, and though
the hair wasn’t very even, not like the
barber does it, because it was most difficult,
still it was beautifully short in
places. Humph had been looking on
almost too astonished to speak, but when
I jumped up and cried, “The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson,” he rushed at
Lionel like I’d told him to.</p>

<p>Lionel, though, spoilt it all. He
always does. He wouldn’t do anything
that was proper, nor have his eyes put
out, but just began to howl. He howled
and howled, and Cousin Florence and
Mother and Father and everybody came
tearing out of the house. They all spoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>at once, and cried out that Lionel’s
appearance was spoilt, and all sorts of
things, and certainly, now that I saw
him properly, he did look rather bad,
and quite ugly. The astonishing part
was that they seemed almost as cross
with Lionel as with us, though I kept
explaining that he’d been asleep all the
time, for that was only fair. Finally
Father sent Humph and me to our
rooms very angrily.</p>

<p>But I didn’t mind that, like I did
Mother’s coming up that evening and
talking to me. It was dreadful. She
said that she was disappointed in me
and not only had I been rude to guests
myself, but I’d made her and Father
seem rude; and she told me that Cousin
Florence and Lionel were going away
early in the morning, so what I’d done
had practically driven them out of the
house. But the worst was when she
said that she had trusted me to look
after the others, because I was the eldest,
and to be a help to her, but now she
found that she couldn’t, and that she
must ask Fräulein to always stop with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>us. I began to wish that I could be
dead.</p>

<p>At last, though, Mother forgave me.
And she said that if I was very good for
a long time, then her confidence in me
would come back again, and so I’m going
to be. And I’m never going to be
Delilah again, never, because I see now
how wicked she was to cut off any one’s
hair without first asking her mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br>
<small>VIOLET’S VISIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE most astonishing part was its
being Violet who was naughty and
not me. I forget if I’ve said anything
about Violet, but the little ones don’t
count very much, for Ted is almost a
baby, and Violet sits all day making doll’s
clothes. Violet is seven, her birthday
was in July, and she has straight, lighty-brown
hair; I think her eyes are brown
too, but she isn’t particularly dark like
me, nor fair like Ted. She isn’t particularly
anything, except good-tempered,
and that she is tremendously. I expect
it’s because she’s rather fat, because all
the rest of us are “lean kine,” and we
certainly aren’t very good-tempered,
although we don’t all have it in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>same way. Humphrey gets sulky and
doesn’t speak at all, and Ted runs
round and round the room slapping
the chairs and saying, “Beast, beast,
beast, beast,” as quickly as ever he
can. As for me, when I get cross, I
want to go away alone, and if I can’t,
I’d like to slap the others, which is
worse than chairs, only I don’t do
it because it makes Mother unhappy;
I believe it hurts her more than
them.</p>

<p>The curiousest part of Violet is that
the things she is told to do are always
the things she likes, so she must be an
“<i>Engel Kind</i>,” as Fräulein says. And
when once she is told a thing, she
remembers it for ever; she’d make a
simply splendid Casabianca. Humphrey
and I always think that, however much
we’d been told to sit still and not
wriggle, when we saw the fire coming,
we’d have forgotten all about it, and
we’d have jumped up and tried to put it
out. It doesn’t seem as if it ought to
have been very difficult with all that
water around, and I dare say the Father
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>would have been just as pleased really
as if we’d all been burnt.</p>

<p>So you can understand now how
astonished we were at Violet’s being
naughty, though perhaps what she did
wasn’t naughtiness exactly, but too much
goodness, which seems to be nearly as
bad. I’ve been wondering since if goodness
isn’t Violet’s besetting sin, but I
suppose it can’t be really. It’s something
like being too punctual, I think.
Father used to tell us that the Duke of
Wellington owed his success in life to
always being half an hour too early, but
all I can say is, it’s lucky he didn’t have
our Fräulein. One day we tried it,
because there’d been such a lot of fuss
about my being late for breakfast, so I
got up exactly half an hour before we
were called, and of course I made the
others get up too. Well, when Fräulein
came in, she simply stormed and
said I was a “<i>Dummkopf</i>,” and did I
want to give Teddy croup playing in
a room without a fire? She set me half
an hour’s extra practising too; so that
just shows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>This all hasn’t anything to do with
Violet’s scrape; that wasn’t my fault in
the least, no one said it was, not even
Fräulein. If it was anybody’s fault, it
was Mother’s, because she hates paying
calls. I should feel just the same if I
were her, because it’s perfectly horrid
having on your best clothes; you can’t
climb trees, nor hang by your legs nor
do anything interesting, but Humphrey
says he shall go calling all day when he’s
grown up, so as to get scones and things
for tea. Humphrey has got an awfully
sweet tooth, and he is rather greedy
besides. Another thing he says is that
he doesn’t mind whom he marries, but
he has settled to have a most enormous
wedding-cake, and to cut it himself. I
like wedding-cake too, but I don’t care
about it as much as all that, and I’d
sooner be a widow, of course.</p>

<p>Well, to go on about Violet. How
it all started was that one evening Father
said to Mother, “You’ve never called
on those Crespignys who’ve come to
live at Boscombe Park. You really must,
you know, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I don’t feel very attracted by them,”
Mother said, and she laughed.</p>

<p>But Father said it was no good being
rude to people, and that the Crespignys
were new comers, so Mother ought to
leave cards this week.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Mother said, “only I
shall be glad when Molly and Violet are
able to pay my calls for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s to be hoped Molly will
discontinue her practice of smashing
people’s best crockery and spilling tea
over their plush sofas,” but, of course, I
rushed at Father for saying that. It is
a shame. I only once dropped a plate
when I was out calling, and once I
upset my cup, but the people happened
to be awfully fussy, and Mother said I
mustn’t pay visits any more. I’m sure
it wasn’t my fault that they had velvet
chairs, and no one seems to remember
that it isn’t pleasant sitting there with
scalding tea trickling down your legs,
and never say a word, like the Spartan
boy.</p>

<p>In the middle of the commotion,
because Father started tickling me when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>I punched him, Violet said suddenly,
“Can’t I go and call on the Crespignys
now?” We were most astonished
because Violet is so shy she generally
cries if she has to see strangers, so I
thought it was just to show she’d be
allowed to, because she doesn’t upset
things like me, and I said very crossly—</p>

<p>“Oh, we all know you are a saint
without your telling us.”</p>

<p>I felt sorry directly afterwards,
because Violet got quite red and I ought
to have remembered that she’s very little
and doesn’t understand much besides
dolls, so I got out Aytoun’s Lays and
stuffed my fingers into my ears to show
I didn’t care at all. All the same I
could hear them talking, and Mother
said to Violet—</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear, I know it wasn’t
that. You shall go to call on the
Crespignys if your new dress comes
home this week, my good little girl.”</p>

<p>Mother was pleased, because she is
always telling Violet she must conquer
her shyness, and she thought she was
trying to. As for me, I felt horrid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>It was the very next day that Mother
got ill, and that made us forget about
the Crespignys and everything. Mother
isn’t very strong, and she often has to
stay in bed, but this was much worse
than usual and we weren’t allowed to
see her for days. The one nice thing
was that Fräulein was in with Mother
nearly all the time, so there was nobody
to bother us and we could do lots of
nice things. We children used even to
have tea alone; we did like it. I used
to pour out, and there were no fines or
anything if we spilt things on the cloth.
Certainly it did get into rather a mess,
but that was mostly because Humphrey
would drink his milk up a bit of
macaroni like the gentlemen do at
Father’s club, only they use a straw.
Cook was so nice too, she used to send
us up hot buttered toast, and it was all
most lovely, except, of course, Mother’s
being ill, which spoilt everything. That
was almost too horrid to bear, especially
when one went to bed.</p>

<p>It was the night that cook was kindest
of all and gave us real tea, that Violet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>wasn’t there. I remember it quite well,
because we were so astonished to see
cook bringing up the teapot instead of
our just having a jug of milk, but she
said a drop would liven us up in a house
of trouble. It is a pity cook can’t
always live in houses of trouble, it
makes her so much nicer. Humphrey
was particularly pleased, because he said
he’d always been wanting to try an
experiment of putting the milk and
sugar into the pot and drinking out of
the spout in turns. I couldn’t let him
do it though until after we’d had first
cups, else there wouldn’t have been any
honour in my being Pourer Out at all.</p>

<p>We’d been wondering where Violet
was ever since tea came, for generally
she’s the only one of us who is punctual
except Teddy, and Fräulein washes his
hands so he can’t help it. I thought
she couldn’t know, so at last I sent
Humph to tell her, though he was
rather cross and would only go after
we’d said three times “Certain true,
black and blue, lay me down and cut
me in two,” that we wouldn’t touch his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>toast. We didn’t like to shout for
Violet, you see, because of Mother.</p>

<p>Well, Humph was gone a long time,
because he always takes longer over
everything than you’d think a person
possibly could, and when he came back
he said he couldn’t find Violet. I wasn’t
surprised at that and I went myself
expecting that I’d see her directly, but
I didn’t. I hunted everywhere, but I
couldn’t find any sign of her, until at
last when I went into our bedroom
again, I noticed that the string had been
taken off the box in which her new dress
had come from the dressmaker’s. I
opened it, and her new dress had gone,
so had her best hat and coat! We
remembered then that we hadn’t seen
her all the afternoon. It was most
astonishing.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do; I really
didn’t. It was quite dark outside by
now so I thought Violet must have gone
out and got lost, and I began to plan
about their bringing her home dead, but
I didn’t want to tell people and get her
into a scrape, besides, Fräulein was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Mother’s room. It didn’t seem either
as if Violet could have done anything
so dreadfully naughty as to go out alone
and get killed, besides wearing her best
clothes on a week-day.</p>

<p>We’d finished tea by now, and we put
crumbs and things in Violet’s place to
pretend she’d been there, but I wouldn’t
let Humph upset her cup, because Violet
is so tidy it wouldn’t have looked more
real at all, and he only wanted to because
he thought it would be so lovely to spill
things on purpose. About six o’clock
Father came in and I was just going to
tell him, but the first thing he said was,
“Why, where’s little Mrs. Roundabout?”
He calls Violet that because
she is so fat.</p>

<p>Father was as surprised as any of us
when he heard she was lost, but he
didn’t think she could have gone out.
“Nonsense,” he said, “she must have
gone to sleep in some corner,” as if
anybody except babies and grown-ups
would go to sleep in the daytime.
However, we searched the house all
over again. It was rather nice at first,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>only then I thought of the Princes in
the Tower and I was afraid I’d find her
body mouldering in the boot cupboard
or somewhere, but we didn’t see anything
at all. Then Father and Stubbins
(he is the gardener) searched all over the
garden with lanterns like in a book, but
they didn’t find anything there either.
After that, they came in again and
Father told Stubbins to go to the village
and make inquiries at every cottage, and
he was just getting ready himself to
bicycle round to all the people we know,
when suddenly the front door opened—and
there was Violet.</p>

<p>She didn’t look a bit naughty, that
was what surprised me most. She was
just smiling to herself like she does
sometimes in church, and she’d got on
her best things, like I thought, and
Mother’s black <i>moiré</i> parasol in one
hand and her ivory card case in the
other and the plush case with the opera
glasses over her arm. I think Father
was all the crosser because she looked
so pleased. Anyway he almost shouted
out, “Where on earth have you been,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>turning the whole house upside down?
Upon my word it’s perfectly intolerable!”</p>

<p>Well, after that it wasn’t any good
talking any more, for Violet began to
cry, and when she once starts she goes
on and on for hours and can’t understand
anything. Father asked her where she’d
been about a hundred times but she
wouldn’t answer, so at last he marched
off, telling her to go upstairs and that
she wasn’t to come down until she’d
apologised.</p>

<p>I did wish Mother was there; she’d
have made it all nice at once. I
remembered though about being the
eldest, and I tried to think of the kind
of things Mother would have done, so I
took Violet’s hand and we went upstairs
together. When we got to the schoolroom
I sat down in the big armchair
and I managed to drag Violet on to my
lap, and I took off her boots and hugged
her and told Humph to try and get
some bread and jam out of cook
because that makes you feel a lot less
miserable. Violet was still crying, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>I sat there, though my arms began to
feel as if they’d drop off, when at last
she sobbed out, “I thought everybody
would be so pleased, and Mother said I
was to.” She wouldn’t say anything
else but just that over and over again,
crying all the time, so, of course, I
couldn’t understand, but I just went on
kissing her and didn’t talk, like Mother
does. It had never been so easy to be
nice to Violet before.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Humph
brought the bread and jam, but when he
did it was strawberry jam, which was
particularly lucky because it’s Violet’s
favourite. I told Humph he’d better
go away again, and then at last Violet
stopped crying, and so I said to her,
“But what was it Mother said you were
to do?”</p>

<p>Violet looked quite surprised, “Why
go and call on the Crespignys, of course.
She partic’ly said I was to, if my new
dress came home.”</p>

<p>I nearly let her roll off my lap. She’d
almost been doing it the whole time
because she’s so fat, but now she nearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>went quite because I was so astonished.
I’d have thought she was making it up,
if it had been one of the others, but
Violet never pretends. “How ever did
you get there?” I said.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe it when she
said she’d walked; it’s more than three
miles each way, and I don’t think even
I have ever walked as far as that.
“Weren’t you very frightened?” I
asked.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I ought to put the
next bit, but it truthfully isn’t bragging
because it is what Violet answered: “I
thought I’d try and be brave like you,”
she said.</p>

<p>Of course, after that I hugged her
again and she went on telling me more.</p>

<p>“I <i>was</i> dreadfully frightened when I
got to the house and went up the big
steps. So I shut my eyes and said,
‘Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,’ and at
the Amen I jumped and pulled the bell.
It made a dreadfully loud ring and
almost at once the door opened and
there were two gentlemen with white
hair but quite young-looking faces and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>such pretty clothes. Oh Molly, I shall
dress Rhoderigo William Wallace like
that with beautiful red plush knickerbockers
and——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” I said, because I was most
interested; it seemed just like in a
story.</p>

<p>“Well, I said to one of the gentlemen,
‘Please is Mrs. Crespigny indoors
because I’ve come to pay a call on her?’
So he said, ‘Yes, her ladyship is at
home, but who might you be, Miss?’
I told him my name was Violet, and
that my Mother didn’t want to come,
besides being ill, and then I handed him
Mother’s card case that I’d filled with
visiting cards of my own, like those you
wrote for the guinea-pig. He took one
out and gave it to the other gentleman,
saying, ‘John, go and ask her ladyship.’
That is what they called Mrs. Crespigny,
so I knew she must be really a princess
and that that was why she had such
beautiful servants.</p>

<p>“There was a lot of laughing somewhere,
but presently Mr. John came
back and said, ‘Walk this way, Miss,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>so I followed him into a big room,
where there were lots of people, but, oh
Molly, they didn’t have crowns on or
satin dresses, or anything, they had
partic’ly ugly clothes, and all the ladies
wore things just like gentlemen, only
not trousers; Mr. John was the only
beautiful one there.</p>

<p>“I was just looking round because
there seemed to be such lots and lots of
people, when a lady came up, I think it
was Mrs. Crespigny, and she said in
rather a cross way, ‘So you’ve come to
call on me because your Mother doesn’t
care to,’ and so I said ‘Yes,’ and every
one laughed, I don’t know why. I
stood there and I didn’t know what to
do until I remembered Mother telling
some one that at calls the ladies talked
about the weather and babies from the
time she went into the room to the time
she came out, so I said ‘Good morning,
your ladyship. It is a lovely day.
Have you got any babies?’</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how I could help
it, because I couldn’t talk about her
babies without knowing if she’d got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>any, but everybody looked as if I’d said
something naughty, and Mrs. Crespigny
went right away very angrily, and just
at that minute Mother’s parasol dropped
with a great clatter, so I thought Mrs.
Crespigny would be really cross, and
when I picked it up, the opera glasses
dropped too. It was dreadful. One
gentleman said, ‘Allow me,’ and he put
them over my arm again just as if I’d
been grown up, and I began to feel a
little better, only then he said, ‘Won’t
you give me a kiss?’ I said, ‘No, thank
you,’ and they all laughed again.</p>

<p>“There’d been a lady standing near,
a very funny lady with a whip in her
hand, and quite a short skirt, and short
hair too, and gaiters like Father’s; and
she said all at once, ‘Dash it all! leave
the kid alone and give it some grub.’
She truthfully did, and she was quite
grown up; but perhaps her mother had
never told her she oughtn’t to use bad
words like that.</p>

<p>“This lady was kind, though she was
so funny. She got me some milk, because
Mother never said I might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>tea when I went calling, though I did
want it, ’specially as lots of people were
having it so funnily in teeny-weeny
little glasses without any milk or sugar;
and the lady got me a nice little pink
cake too. Then she sat down beside
me and asked me why I’d come, and she
hardly seemed to believe it when I told
her Mother had said I could go and pay
calls instead of her now. She asked me
about the opera glasses too, so I said I
knew people took them when they went
out, but I hadn’t been sure about calls,
only I thought it was a good thing
always to be on the safe side, like Jane
says. The funny lady asked me who
Jane was, and I said, ‘Our housemaid,’
and the funny lady said it was a wise
rule, although perhaps opera glasses
were not very customary when calling.</p>

<p>“Just at this minute I looked up, and
I saw a most ’stonishing thing. A lady
was holding a cigarette, and a gentleman
was striking a match to light it. The
gentleman saw me looking and he began
to laugh, and he called out, ‘Take care,
or that little girl’s eyes will drop out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>her head with fright.’ Then he said,
‘Haven’t you ever seen a lady smoke
before?’ and I said, ‘No ladies ever do
smoke,’ and they all laughed again, I
don’t know why. They seemed to be
always laughing.</p>

<p>“The clock struck then, and that
made me think of the time, so I asked
them if I’d been there twenty minutes
yet, because I’d forgotten to look when
I came in. I’d asked Father yesterday
how long people ought to stay at calls,
and he told me he believed twenty
minutes was the correct time. One
gentleman said I’d been in the room
twenty-one minutes, fifteen seconds and
three-quarters, so I went out quickly.
I didn’t know if I ought to shake hands
with Mr. John and the other beautiful
one at the door, but I had such a lot
of things to carry I thought they’d
excuse me, so I just said goodbye.
That’s all. It was such a long way
home I thought it would never come.
It was such a very long way.”</p>

<p>Wasn’t that astonishing? I hadn’t
interrupted Violet, because I wanted to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>hear it all, though of course I knew that
she’d made a mistake, and that Mother
had never meant that she should go and
call on the Crespignys alone. It was
no good saying anything when she’d
finished because she was nearly asleep,
so I just went and helped her to go to
bed.</p>

<p>Then I went down and told Father.
I tried to tell him exactly what Violet
had said, and he simply roared with
laughter. I didn’t think it was funny
myself, but just like a story; and I do
think Violet was very brave. Father
went up at once to forgive her and say
good-night, but she was too sleepy to
understand anything except that it was
all right.</p>

<p>Violet didn’t go calling any more,
but the very next Christmas a most
lovely mother-of-pearl card case came
for her, with her initials on, which just
shows that if you really try to be good
it is nice in the end. When Mother
saw it, she said she thought the funny
lady must have sent it, the one who
talked bad words, but Violet always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>believes it was a present from Mr.
John. She has made Rhoderigo
William Wallace a pair of red velvet
knickerbockers out of a bit from
Fräulein’s old bonnet, and they are
most beautiful, except that he can’t sit
down. Perhaps that is why Mr. John
never did either.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>
<small>THE WHIPPING OF TEDDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE were all sitting so happily one
evening when Mother told us.
She had been reading aloud to us, as she
always does on Sundays after tea, and
it was the <i>Water-Babies</i>. It is a most
lovely story, and makes you want to
drown dreadfully, but we had just got
to the end. “That’s all,” Mother said,
and shut the book. Then she stopped
a minute. “Chicks, Mother has got to
go a long journey too, to the Other-end-of-Nowhere,
like little Tom.”</p>

<p>Well, we all thought Mother was
joking, and we laughed. Teddy was
sitting on her lap, because he is the
littlest, and we all snuggle down on the
rug around. The Dustman had come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>to him rather, because it was past his
bedtime, only he stays up later on
Sundays. “Teddy going to the Other-end-of-Nowhere,”
he said, in a very
sleepy way.</p>

<p>We all laughed again at that. “Yes,
and Mother is Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby,”
Humphrey said. Mother
didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“Are we really going away,
Mother?” I asked.</p>

<p>I looked up then, and I was most
astonished. Mother’s eyes were full of
tears. “Little Tom had to go alone,”
she said, “and poor Mother must go
alone too, without her Water-babies.”</p>

<p>All at once I got frightened. I
clutched Mother’s hand hard and sat
still. I didn’t seem able to speak at all.
“But how long for, Mother?” Humph
asked. “Fwee days?” Because Mother
does sometimes go away from Friday to
Monday with Father, although we all
grumble very much.</p>

<p>We couldn’t see Mother’s face at all,
for she was kissing Teddy’s head. He
was quite asleep by now. “No, for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>much longer time than that,” she said;
“for more than three months—for the
whole winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, no!” Humph and
Violet called out; but I still couldn’t
speak. I seemed to have expected it
somehow. “But why, Mother, why?”
Humphrey said. “We haven’t been
very naughty.”</p>

<p>Then Mother told us. She said that
when she was so ill last month (the
time that Violet went calling all alone)
our doctor had said that he thought
she mustn’t be in England for the cold
weather. And yesterday, when she went
up to London with Father, she had been
to see a very great doctor, and he had
said just the same, and that she must
start off almost directly.</p>

<p>“But take us, take us too, Mother,”
Humph begged. Still I couldn’t say
anything.</p>

<p>“I can’t, my little son, I can’t. We
aren’t rich enough. It is difficult for
Father even to find the money for
Mother to go alone.”</p>

<p>“Think how nice it will be when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>I come back again,” Mother said
presently. “It will be getting summer,
and we’ll go for lovely picnics in the
woods. And there will be surprises in
my box, such surprises for each one
of you!”</p>

<p>“Mother going away for two, five,
six, a million years!” Teddy shouted
suddenly. He clapped his hands and
laughed as if it were something nice.</p>

<p>Well, I couldn’t help it; it seemed
more than one could bear. “Be quiet,
you hateful, horrid idiot!” I said.
“If you are glad Mother is going,
every one isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush, Molly!” Mother said.
“Teddy is so little, he doesn’t understand.”
She laid her hand on my
head. Then no one said anything for
a long time. Violet had started off to
cry, and Humph was crying too, though
he pretended he wasn’t, so he wouldn’t
blow his nose, but kept on kind of
snorting. It couldn’t have been that
his handkerchief was dirty, because it
was Sunday. As for me, I was behind
Mother’s chair, and no one could see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>me. Teddy was the only happy one;
he’d gone to sleep again.</p>

<p>“Oh, children, children!” all at once
Mother said. “Don’t make it harder
for me. Mother hates to go.”</p>

<p>Well, I hadn’t thought about it that
way before. There was Mother going
all alone, and at least I’d got the Count
of Aulon, (he’s my rat), besides the
others.</p>

<p>“You’ll—you’ll get quite strong
there, Mother, won’t you? and be
able to run races and—and all sorts
of things, when you come back?”
My voice was hardly funny at all.</p>

<p>But suddenly Mother began to cry;
she really did. “My little ones! oh,
my ‘preshun cats!’” she whispered.
That’s what we like her to call us when
we are very cuddly. And for a minute
we all sort of cried together.</p>

<p>“Why, this will never do; Mother
is the biggest baby of you all,” Mother
said, and she smiled. “Soon there
will be a big pond on the carpet,
and you will be really water-babies.
Wouldn’t Teddy be surprised to wake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>up and find himself swimming about
the drawing-room. Come, we must
put the wee man to bed.” As Mother
laughed, of course we all laughed too.</p>

<p>Well, in the next few days we got
more used to the idea of Mother’s going
away, and it didn’t seem quite so dreadful.
She told us that she was going to
a place called Algiers, where there were
black people, real live ones walking
about the streets in funny clothes, and
that she’d draw pictures of them for us,
and of course that was very interesting.
But still we were pretty miserable—all
except Teddy. It seemed as if I couldn’t
forgive him. He didn’t mind a bit
more than he had done the first evening,
even when he was quite awake. I began
to think he hadn’t got any heart, like
Nero. Now Humph, though at times
you’d think he cared about nothing but
what sort of pudding there was going
to be for dinner, yet when big sort of
things come, you just find out he does.
And he is most awfully brave too,
Humph is. Once he chopped a piece
off his finger and the blood was simply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>pouring out, and all he said was, “Tie
on the bit, quick; it must kneel by first
attention.” I don’t know what he
meant, but there’d been a gentleman
staying who talked a lot of doctoring
stuff with Father, so I expect it was
some of that. Anyway, it was very
brave.</p>

<p>The days before Mother went seemed
each about as long as five ordinary days,
and yet very short too. It was a funny
thing. At last the morning came for
her to start. We had to get up very
early, because she and Father were
going by the 7.45 train, and so the
lamp was lit at breakfast, and that
always makes you feel queer and choky.
Mother couldn’t eat anything, and
Father was sort of scolding her all the
time to get her to; and we were sitting
as close to her as we could squeeze, all
dressed anyhow, and not having had
time to brush our teeth—at least,
Humph and I hadn’t. As for Ted,
Fräulein hadn’t dressed him at all, but
had just brought him down to say goodbye
in his little scarlet dressing-gown,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>which is made out of my old winter
jacket; he sat on Mother’s lap and tried
to hold a fork with his toes, and he still
seemed quite happy. I’d have liked to
shake him if I hadn’t been so miserable
myself.</p>

<p>At last there was a ring at the bell,
and it was the fly. “Now do try to
drink up your coffee, my dear,” Father
said; but Mother said, “I can’t, I
can’t.” “Well, we must start at once,”
Father said. It was all very well for
him, for he was going to London with
Mother and down to the ship to see
her off.</p>

<p>Mother got up though, and put
Teddy into the big chair by the fire,
kissing him all the while. He had still
got the fork in his toes. “Look, look,
Teddy eat breakfast with his feet!”
he called out, pointing to them. He
didn’t seem able to think of anything
else.</p>

<p>Mother went out into the hall with
the rest of us clinging to her, and down
the garden path to the fly. Just as she
was getting in, Father or some one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>asked if she’d got her keys, and Jane
the housemaid had to go tearing indoors
for them. While we were waiting,
Fräulein looked round and gave a little
cry. There was Teddy creeping down
the garden, his little toes all curling up
as they touched the ground, and no fork
at all.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach</i>, you naughty, naughty <i>Kindchen</i>!
Go in out of the cold. You will have
your death,” cried Fräulein, and she
rushed back and carried him into the
house and then came out again shutting
the front door.</p>

<p>It took two or three minutes for
Mother to get settled in the fly and the
luggage to be arranged, and then we all
hugged her in a sort of a heap and they
began to drive off, Mother kissing her
hand out of the window. I didn’t see
that though, Humph told me afterwards,
because I was running indoors as hard as
I could tear and as it was I could only
just hold in the crying until I got to
the bathroom. I’ve discovered that you
can pull out a bit of the wood that’s
round the bath and creep in sort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>behind, so it’s a lovely place for times of
trouble. At least, I didn’t exactly discover
the place, but I saw it when the
man came to mend the taps; he was a
very nice man and gave me some putty.</p>

<p>Well, when I got into the bathroom,
I was very surprised to see that the bit
of wood had been pulled out already and
was lying on the floor, and then when I
began to crawl in I was still more surprised
because there was a funny noise
coming from inside, like the guinea-pig
makes when he is excited. I was so
astonished that I stopped crying.</p>

<p>I crawled quickly, though it’s very
squeezy, but, of course, that’s really a
great ’vantage because no grown-up could
possibly come after. And when I got
to the end, there was a large curled-up
heap; I couldn’t see much because it’s
almost dark, but I thought it must be a
dear dog, so I put out my hand to feel.
It was something soft, but not like a dog,
more like a person; then I felt some
curly hair. “Teddy!” I called out,
most amazed, because I didn’t know any
of them knew of this place but me. (I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>hadn’t meant to be mean in not telling,
but one must keep somewhere for times
of great trouble.)</p>

<p>The funny noise was still going on,
and then I remembered it’s what Teddy
does, when he cries very hard; he hardly
ever cries at all though, that’s how I’d
forgotten. “What is the matter, Ted?”
I said. I couldn’t cuddle him because
there wasn’t room, but I stroked him as
well as I could lying on my stomach.</p>

<p>“Go in out of the cold,” he said.
“Go in out of the cold. Mother gone
away for a million years. Go in out of
the cold.”</p>

<p>I felt I loved him ever so much more
to find he really did mind about Mother
going away. “But, Teddy, you’d have
only seen Mother for a minute more, if
Fräulein hadn’t sent you in out of the
cold,” I told him.</p>

<p>Then he began to squeak with crying
more than ever. “I was g—going to
c—creep under the c—carriage-seat and
be a st—stowboy on the ship. And
c—come out at the place with b—black
people. I’d g—got a c—crust of bread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>in my d—dressing-gown pocket all r—ready.
Mother g—gone away for a
m—million years.”</p>

<p>Wasn’t that a good plan? I should
never have thought Teddy could have
invented anything so sensible. I said,
“Did you make it all up yourself?”
and he said, “Yes,” very pleased, because
he saw that I admired it. What made
me feel dreadful though, was that all
these days I’d thought he didn’t care and
was going to grow up like Nero.</p>

<p>Just then we heard Fräulein calling,
“Teddy, Teddy, where are you?” as if
she were in a great state of mind. So I
said we must come else she’d discover
the secret place. We crawled out and I
shut up the little door carefully. Then
I shouted, “Teddy’s in here, Fräulein.”</p>

<p>I thought that Fräulein would be
cross, but she wasn’t; I suppose it was
to sort of make up for Mother’s going,
besides she’s nearly always nice to
Teddy. She just laughed and said,
“<i>Du böser Bube</i>; you have me so
frightened.”</p>

<p>She took hold of Ted’s hand and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>taking him away to dress him, but he
caught hold of me. “Molly get me up
to-day,” he said.</p>

<p>I <i>was</i> pleased. You see it had often
made me feel rather horrid Teddy’s being
so much fonder of Fräulein than he is
of me. Another thing I didn’t like was
that when Teddy was a baby, a real
baby I mean, I used to cuddle and nurse
him heaps, but lately he’d said it was
silly and that I didn’t do it to Humph.
He wouldn’t even let me kiss him.</p>

<p>It was when I was dressing Ted that
I found out something. He was telling
me more about his plan for going with
Mother and how he had meant to wait
hidden in the carriage until she got into
the train, and then scramble under the
seat of the train when she wasn’t
looking. “You see I thinked I could
do it, because everybody says I’m
so small. You don’t call it a silly
plan?”</p>

<p>“No, it was a lovely plan,” I said.</p>

<p>“I was ’fraid you call it silly. And
if I think of lots and lots of lovely plans,
will you soon, in three, eight, a million
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>days let me play in the games with you
and Humph?”</p>

<p>“But you do sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you think I’m a bother.”</p>

<p>I did feel horrid, because he is rather
a bother, but we hadn’t meant him to
find it out. “There’s nobody for me
to play with,” he said, beginning to
squeak again, “Violet’s always doing
her dolls and Mother’s gone away for
a million——”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a new game, and there
will be a real part for you, like Humph’s,”
I said quickly.</p>

<p>Teddy clapped his hands and jumped
for joy. “And will you knock me
about and tortoise me just like you
do Humph?” He meant torture
only he didn’t quite know the right
word.</p>

<p>I said “Yes,” and I began to think
of a game that minute. “I’ve got a
lovely one out of the book Mother has
been reading to us,” I said. “I’ll be the
Sweep Grimes, and you’ll be little Tom.
I shall always shout at you with horrid
words and beat you dreadfully and send
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>you up the most difficult wiggly
chimneys.”</p>

<p>“And light straw under if I don’t go
up quick enough.” Ted jigged up and
down, so that I could hardly brush his
hair; he hugged me all of himself.</p>

<p>Humph and I get excited over our
games sometimes, but I don’t think we
ever were so excited as Ted got. I
believe he never thought about anything
else. He used to ask me to come up
and say good-night to him, because of
course he goes to bed earlier than us,
and then he’d hug me and whisper,
“Fräulein doesn’t know, but I haven’t
really had my broth but just a mouldy
crust, and I’m not really wearing my
new pyjamas but just old rags, and this
isn’t really a bed at all but just a heap
of dirty straw;” and I’d say in an
awful Grimesy voice, “Be quiet, else I’ll
kick you out to sleep in the street.”</p>

<p>All the same, it was through this
game that Teddy got into such trouble.
One afternoon it was very cold and
there was a horrid wind, so Fräulein
said that Teddy had better not come for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>a walk with the rest of us, because of
getting croupy. “I will lend you my
German picture-book, with the pictures
that move, as a treat,” she said, “and
you must be very good.” Then she
asked Jane to give an eye to him every
now and then.</p>

<p>We hate going out for walks, it’s so
dull, and this one was particularly
horrid. We were very glad to get back,
and we rushed to the schoolroom fire.</p>

<p>“Why, where’s Teddy?” Fräulein
said. “He must have gone to the
dining-room.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t in the dining-room either,
nor in the kitchen. Jane’s sister had
come to tea (the one who has got a
beautiful tooth that unscrews), and they
were all talking and laughing very loud.</p>

<p>“Where’s Master Teddy?” Fräulein
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was looking at a book not a
minute ago as good as gold, Miss,” Jane
said, and went on talking. The servants
do get rather different when Mother and
Father are away, though Jane is most
kind. Last Sunday she let me warm the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>sort of scissors thing for her that she
curls her hair with, and she has
promised to lend it to me one day. It
will be lovely for tortures.</p>

<p>Fräulein began calling, “Teddy,
Teddy,” but he didn’t answer. She
went and looked in all the bedrooms
and seemed to get quite frightened.
“<i>Ach Herzliebchen!</i>” she kept muttering,
“if harm should have befallen thee
and <i>die Mutter</i> away.” I wondered if
he could have started paying calls like
Violet!</p>

<p>At last I opened the drawing-room
door. We hadn’t thought of looking
there directly because we never use the
room when Mother is away. And what
I saw surprised me so that I stood quite
still.</p>

<p>There was a dust-sheet laid out on
the floor very neatly, and it was all
covered with soot. A lot of soot had
got on the carpet, too, around. All the
vases on the mantelpiece were covered
with soot and standing quite deep in it,
and the pictures near had a layer of soot
on the tops. Even the chairs had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>good lot of soot on them. And there
in the middle, hanging down in the fireplace
were a pair of bare and very sooty
legs.</p>

<p>“Teddy,” Fräulein called loud and
angrily. She had come in behind
me without my noticing her. There
was a sort of scuffle, and Teddy came
tumbling down the chimney into the
fender, bringing a whole cloud of soot
with him. He had only got his shirt
on, and he had the hearthbrush in one
hand and the poker in the other. He
was dirtier than any one I ever saw; he
did look beautifully real though.</p>

<p>“It wanted sweeping awfully, couldn’t
have been done for a million years,” he
spluttered, very pleased.</p>

<p>Well, Fräulein was furious. I don’t
think I’ve ever seen her so angry, certainly
not with Teddy. And now the
awful part comes. She caught hold of
Teddy and whipped him, really whipped
him, not fun!</p>

<p>Teddy was so astonished that for the
first two slaps he never made a sound;
then he simply howled. He sobbed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>with squeaks all the way into the bathroom,
and all the time Fräulein bathed
him and all the time she dried him, and
when she carried him into the schoolroom
and put him in front of the fire,
he was still sobbing. Fräulein went to
get him out some clean clothes and
things but he stood there, wrapped in a
big bath towel, sobbing and sobbing and
squeaking until I couldn’t bear it.</p>

<p>I went and put my arm round him.
I’d thought it rather a shame all the
time, because I don’t see that he’d been
so very naughty. No one had ever told
him he mustn’t climb up chimneys and
sweep them. Of course it was very
silly of him, and I knew Mother
wouldn’t like the soot all over the
drawing-room carpet, especially when
it’s Persian and the best one in the
house, not to mention the chairs and
pictures and it’s being a trouble for the
servants. Still I’m sure Mother wouldn’t
have whipped Teddy. So I put my
arms round him and whispered, “Never
mind, Ted, it’s all right now. It’s all
right.” Fräulein came into the room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>but she didn’t say anything. She gave
me his shirt and knickerbockers to put
on, and went off to get his stockings.
I believe she was rather sorry she’d done
it herself.</p>

<p>At last Teddy began to speak, though
he was still sobbing. “Th—there’s one
th—thing, though, she th—thinks she
h—hurt me, but she d—didn’t; no, not
a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I didn’t, why are you
crying, then?” Fräulein said, who had
come in suddenly.</p>

<p>Teddy didn’t answer. He went on
sobbing, but much less. Suddenly he
whispered in my ear, “She didn’t
h—hurt me h—half as much as you
often do when we’re Grimesing,” and
then he smiled a little bit.</p>

<p>So I said, “Shall I be Grimes now?”
and he nodded. Fräulein had gone
away again by now.</p>

<p>“And we’ll pretend you swept a
chimney at a very grand house and made
rather a mess.” Then I went on in
the awful voice, “You scamp, I’ll thrash
you within two inches of your life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“With a rope end?” Teddy said.
He began to look quite happy. “I
saw a piece in the stable-yard yesterday,
Molly,” he went on, sort of coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Shall I go out and get it to knock
you with?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly!”—he put both his
arms round my neck and gave a little
shriek for happiness—“Oh, Molly, I do
love you!”</p>

<small>THE RAGE OF THE HEATHEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I  ADVISE you not ever to be a
missionary. I don’t mean the
proper sort that get eaten up by
savages and cassowaries, because you
can’t do that until you’re grown up; but
don’t try and be a missionarying child
at home. If you do, the most disagreeable
things will happen, though perhaps
that part wouldn’t have been so bad if
Mother had been there.</p>

<p>It was in November, very soon after
Mother had gone away, that Humphrey
and I went to the children’s service. I
know it was then because the day before
had been Guy Fawkes day, and so
everything seemed dull and horrid, like
it does when there’s just been something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>very nice, and that was why we went.
Jane took us—she’s the housemaid
and very fond of things like that, not
only reading the Bible, which any one
would enjoy, but she loves the most
difficult books of sermons and prayers,
and she doesn’t even think the litany a
little bit too long.</p>

<p>I don’t mean that it was Jane that
made us think about being missionaries;
it was the clergyman himself. He was
a stranger, and his sermon wasn’t a bit
like other sermons; it was most interesting,
and it was all about setting
a good example and being an influence
unto righteousness in the lives of little
brothers and sisters and lots of things
like that. I began to think he must
know I was the eldest.</p>

<p>Well, I listened to every word he
said, I truthfully did, and all the way
coming home I talked to Humphrey
about it, and planned how to be a home
missionary. We settled that we must
be very kind to the Poor Heathens—those
were Violet and Ted—because
they didn’t know any better, but that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>we’d have to be very firm. Of course,
it was rather silly for Humph to be
talking like that, because he was really a
Poor Heathen too, but he didn’t seem to
understand that part properly. I didn’t
like to explain it to him then either,
and that was the first great mistake,
because afterwards he used to get
awfully sulky and cross about it, which
just showed that he really was a heathen
like I said. Besides, how could he
possibly be anything else?</p>

<p>The clergyman had said one mustn’t
put off doing good, so I started directly
we got home. Fräulein had gone out
to see a friend, and we were to have tea
alone, which was a good thing, because
it made it easier. I went and tidied
myself very nicely, and then I came
into the schoolroom. I said, “Violet
and Ted, have you washed your hands
for tea?”</p>

<p>They both looked most astonished.
Violet said, “Of course I have, I
always do,” which is quite true, but I
thought she might just have forgotten
that once. That was the worst of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Violet though, she was so good she
made a perfectly horrid heathen. Teddy
only laughed and said, “Fräulein forgot
to wash mine and now she’s gone out.
Hooray!”</p>

<p>So then I began to talk quite properly.
I said, “That doesn’t make the least
difference; you should do your duty
in life, if any one is there to make you
or not.” I said lots more, too, just as
nice. I said, “It’s a horrible habit to
sit down to table with dirty hands, and
any gentleman would scorn such a foul
deed.” I made him come with me to
wash them at once, though he didn’t
like it, ’specially when I cut his nails,
every one, and pushed them all down
most beautifully.</p>

<p>The other two had nearly finished tea
by the time we came back. It <i>was</i>
naughty of them. Of course, I had to
tell them of it, so I began to talk again,
but really, it wasn’t a bit crossly. I
spoke more in sorrow than in anger. I
said that such disgraceful behaviour was
excusable in Violet, as she was so little,
but that I should have thought that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Humphrey would have known better.
I said that in any respectable society
they always waited to begin meals for
the Pourer Out. They both looked very
cross, but they didn’t say anything. For
one thing, Humph’s mouth was too full.
Suddenly he got down from his chair
without asking any permission, and
walked across to the fireplace. Then
he started toasting his bread and
butter!</p>

<p>Well, I really didn’t want to make
any more fusses, but what was I to do?
Fräulein had particularly said we weren’t
to toast our slices, because the butter
will drip about, besides its being too
nice to be good for you. So I just said
very firmly, “Come and sit in your
place this minute.” Well, he didn’t.
Being a missionary is very difficult.</p>

<p>Of course I started talking again,
though I’d hardly had a bit of tea, and
I was most hungry. I said that Humphrey
was disobeying Fräulein, who had
been set in authority over us, and that
it was just as bad as breaking laws, and
that he might as well commit murder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>or anything. I said very likely one day
he would. He said he didn’t care, and
that it didn’t say anything in the Bible
about not making toast, and that
Mother had never told us not to either.
I said any way Mother had always told
us to do what Fräulein said, but it all
wasn’t the least use.</p>

<p>I had to let him do it, for I couldn’t
threaten to tell Fräulein—that seemed
too mean. I couldn’t drag him away
either, because he’d got the slice on his
knife, and I thought he might get cut.
Of course, I might have got hurt too,
but that would have been quite right
for a missionary, and rather nice. Any
way, I determined that he shouldn’t do
any more, so I took the plate with all
the rest of the bread and butter on my
lap and held it tight. Then I sat in
silence and dignity.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t have thought that even
Humph could have taken so long over
one bit of toast, but I expect he did it
to pay me out; it was all frizzly and
smelt most delicious. I sat there, though,
and never moved except when I gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>the little ones more. I couldn’t eat a
single mouthful myself. Even that
didn’t make me cross. I said in the
nicest way at the end, “And now,
children, we’ll have grace.”</p>

<p>Well, you see, the worst of it was
we don’t generally say grace except at
dinner, so Humph answered directly,
“Why should we? We never do,” and
Teddy copies every one, so he shouted
out, too, “Sha’n’t; we never do.” As
for Violet, she just looked astonished.</p>

<p>“My dear children,” I said most
exactly like the clergyman, “we are
certainly going to have grace, and I
shall say it,” but before I could begin
Humphrey roared out, “If we have
gwace I shall say it, because I’m a man.”
It was dreadfully silly; just as if he
could, when besides being younger, he
was only a heathen!</p>

<p>I tried to explain this to him kindly,
I really did, but he wouldn’t understand.
So it ended in our both shouting out,
“For what we have received the Lord
make us truly thankful,” at the tops of
our voices, with our hands over our ears,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>which didn’t seem quite right, and
suddenly in the middle the bread-and-butter
plate fell off my lap—crash! It
was broken to little bits.</p>

<p>That was the first disagreeable thing
that happened, for not even missionaries
like their pocket-money to be stopped
for two weeks, but there were lots more
to come. And it wasn’t only big things
that were horrid, being a missionary
seemed to make everybody cross the
whole day long. Now there was Father.
You see, I was trying hard to be good
myself, besides improving the Poor
Heathens, so I’d settled to count ten
every time before I spoke, and then I’d
not be led into evil and profane discourse.
I got the idea out of a book I’d been
reading. Well, instead of liking it,
Father used to get dreadfully vexed;
the trouble was that he generally asked
me the question again before I got to
ten, and then I had to start counting all
over again, so it was quite a long time
sometimes before I could answer. I did
think it seemed rather silly myself, when
he’d only asked me something like,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Have you been out to-day?” because
it wasn’t likely that I should have replied
anything very dreadful. But in the
book it said that one can never tell, and
that habit is everything. I did wish
that Father hadn’t thought me muttering
and sulky.</p>

<p>What I minded most, though, was the
way the others went on. They used to
stop up their ears whenever they saw me
coming and run away. It was dreadful.
Some days I’d forget to talk to them
about their sins, and then we’d be quite
happy, but I always fined myself afterwards.
I used to throw a farthing into
the pig-sty each time, because I thought
if I gave it to any one I’d get pleasure
out of it, so that oughtn’t to count; I
used to have fines for lots of other
wrong things too. Besides this, I’d
hit myself with whips and straps to
try and make me gooder, but it’s
very difficult to hurt oneself much.
It was a better mortification when I
wore Humphrey’s new jersey under all
my clothes, because, though it wasn’t
hairy, nor a shirt, it was very rough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>and tight, but Fräulein discovered it
and was most cross.</p>

<p>It was because I hated the others
always running away from me that I
took to writing about their wickedness
instead. I pretended that I was a dumb
missionary, and so it wasn’t my fault,
and I used to push little notes into their
pockets all in printing, so as to be easy
to read, but after the first they threw
them away without looking at them, so
it was no use at all. That’s what made
me take to writing things on the walls,
where they couldn’t help seeing them,
like in our room I put, “Don’t have the
cat in bed,” for Violet to read, because
Fräulein doesn’t like us to. In the
dining-room I put, “It’s horrible to
drink with your mouth full,” opposite
to where Humphrey sits. Instead of
being pleased, though, Fräulein got in
a rage again, and said I was spoiling the
wall-paper, and made me rub it all out.
It did seem difficult to do good.</p>

<p>It was after this that I thought of
writing placards. It was all my own
idea, and didn’t hurt anything, and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>just as good as putting it on the wall.
I forgot to say that I hadn’t invented
that plan myself. I took it out of
<i>Belshazzar’s Feast</i>, and I do think they
must have made much worse marks than
I did, because in the piece of poetry we
learnt it says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">  “In that same hour and hall,</div>
<div class="indent">The fingers of a hand</div>
<div class="verse">Came forth against the wall,</div>
<div class="indent">And wrote as if on sand.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>So it must have made great holes. I
suppose the plaster was wet. At any
rate, I thought that with the placards
no one could possibly grumble.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have done the placards, of
course, if I hadn’t known just the sort
of naughty things that the Heathens
would do. So I wrote very big on
large sheets of paper, “DON’T,” and
then a whole heap of different wrong
things. I kept them all stuffed up the
front of my dress (it was rather loose,
because of my growing so fast, and that
was the only helping part I had). Then
when the others were naughty I got out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>the right placard, for they were all put
like the alphabet, most beautifully, and
I waved it in front of them. They used
to get dreadfully cross, and Humph
tore a good many trying to snatch them
away, but I always wrote them again.
It <i>was</i> a good idea!</p>

<p>It was out of the placards, though, that
all the trouble came; at least, it was
partly that and partly our not hearing
that Father had come home unexpectedly.
You see, it was after we’d gone to bed,
so we couldn’t possibly guess it of ourselves.
So the next morning, when I
heard the water running in the bathroom,
which is next door to the room
where Violet and I sleep, I thought of
course it must be Humphrey. Ted
doesn’t have baths in the morning
because of being croupy, and, as I said,
I didn’t know that Father was at home;
besides, he always gets up much later.
I’d been wanting to be awake when
Humph had his bath for a long while,
so I jumped up quickly, though it was
very cold, and put on my dressing-gown
and tore round to the bathroom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>door. Then I pushed a new placard
under the crack, a very big one all
done in red ink. It said, “Dirty Pig,
scrub your toe-nails.”</p>

<p>Well, I thought Humphrey might be
cross, but I didn’t expect what really
happened. There was a roar like a
lion, and the door was pulled back,
and there stood a perfectly strange
gentleman. He was in his shirt and
trousers; he was rather fat, and his
face was scarlet; he could hardly speak,
he was in such a rage.</p>

<p>I was so astonished I couldn’t say
anything either. At last he did. He
shouted out, “<i>Unverschämtes Fraunzimmer</i>.”
He said a lot more too that
I didn’t quite understand, though it
was only in German. Then he suddenly
slammed the door in my face.</p>

<p>Well, of course after that I didn’t
feel very comfortable. I went back to
my room and dressed myself, but my
legs were all going wiggle-waggle most
horridly, and I had a pain inside. I did
want Mother. I wanted her so that I
felt I must burst or something. I tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>the plan of thinking that when I was an
old, old woman I should have stopped
being unhappy about this horrid time,
but there wasn’t any comfort in that
like there generally is.</p>

<p>We children had breakfast in the
schoolroom, because we always do when
there are visitors, but I felt so sick that
I could hardly eat any. And in the
middle it happened. Father dashed in,
just as I expected. He was dreadfully
angry. I don’t think I have ever seen
him so angry. He said that the German
gentleman was a most celebrated musician,
and even if I had heard any idiotic chatter
of the maids about his not attending to
his personal appearance, how dared I
take it on myself to give him moral
maxims worded in the most insulting
language? I didn’t exactly know what
Father meant by that, but it sounded
horrid. Also, he said that I stuck myself
up as being better than any one,
and that my conceit was perfectly insufferable.
After a lot more besides,
he ended up by telling me that I should
be sent to boarding school at once.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Then he rushed out of the room
again.</p>

<p>I hadn’t said anything all the time
Father was speaking, and I hadn’t cried
at all, because I wouldn’t let myself.
As soon as he’d gone I ran away to our
bedroom. I couldn’t hide in my secret
trouble place, because I didn’t feel that
I could ever bear to go into the bathroom
again. The worst of it was our
door doesn’t lock, for Humphrey lost
the key once when we were wicked
gaolers of the Tower, but I barricaded
it with chairs. Then, of course, I did
cry. I cried awfully until everything
got quite dizzy. I was still crying when
Humphrey climbed in at the window,
but I seemed too miserable to mind.
He was most nice though. He didn’t
talk, but he stroked my hand and
shoved his big peppermint into it, just
as if there hadn’t been any horrid missionarying.
Then, when I didn’t move,
he said, “Father won’t go on being
cwoss;” and I said, “I wish I were
dead.” So I did. It’s a horrid feeling
to have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>All of a sudden Humph said, “Why
don’t you ’splain it was <i>my</i> dirty toe-nails?”
I just sobbed out, “I don’t
know.” It was very sensible, really,
what Humph said, but I was too unhappy
to see that; besides, I was thinking
more about the other things Father had
scolded me about. I said, “I don’t
think I’m better than other people, I
don’t, I don’t! I think I’m a beast,
and horrible.” Humph said, “No,
you’re not.” Then he wagged his
head, and went away.</p>

<p>The part that comes next I didn’t
know at the time, of course, but Humph
told me about it afterwards. He <i>was</i>
nice; he can be most ’straordinarily
sensible sometimes, though you’d never
think it. He went straight to the
study where the German gentleman
was sitting, and said, “It was <i>my</i> toe-nails.”</p>

<p>The German gentleman jumped up
very quickly, but Humph went on
telling him. He said, “You see, I
don’t scrub mine very much because
it tickles. My sister didn’t even know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>about yours.” He talked in German,
because that’s one of the funny things
about Humph, he likes it. It was
lucky though, because we found out
afterwards it always pleased the German
gentleman to hear his own language.
Then Humph pulled off his shoes and
stockings to show his feet. It sounds a
naughty thing to do in the drawing-room,
but I don’t think it really was.</p>

<p>The German gentleman looked very
astonished, but he didn’t look cross,
Humphrey told me. At last he said,
“<i>So</i>; but why was it written out and
pushed under the door like that?”</p>

<p>“Because I stop up my ears and
won’t listen when she speaks to me,”
Humph explained. He went on and
told the German gentleman all about
the missionarying, and the gentleman
seemed very interested. Then at the
end Humph said, “But my sister is
starving; she didn’t eat hardly nothing
for bweakfast, and no biscuits at eleven,
and she won’t even suck my peppermint.
I think she’ll soon be dead and it’ll be
you that’s done it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>When the German gentleman heard
that he was very nice, Humph said. Of
course he must have known that people
can live longer than that without food
on desert islands and places, though
Humph was really frightened about it.
He took hold of Humph’s hand and
said, “<i>Ach!</i> then we must go quickly
and ask that the little sister may be forgiven.”
I believe he liked boys better
than girls anyway, which does seem
funny.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew of all this,
though, was Father coming up to my
room. He said in quite a different
way, “Cheer up, Molly, I hear it was
only a mistake. You must be more
discreet in your sisterly admonitions
though.” It made me feel much
better. I went down and told the
German gentleman that I was sorry I’d
seemed rude. He was all right, but
things weren’t really comfortable until
he and Father went away again the
next day.</p>

<p>I didn’t do any more missionarying
after that though; it seemed to be too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>dangerous. It was a comfort to stop.
Besides, the next week I got a letter
from Mother, explaining that the
clergyman couldn’t have meant it like
that at all, because the chief thing if you
want to have a good influence over
people is that they should be fond of
you, so a plan that prevents that must
be a mistake. She said, too, that
people didn’t generally have a good
influence unless it was unconscious, so
my best way was just to leave the
others alone and try and be good
myself. But she said I needn’t worry
too much even over that (she seemed
to guess all about my finings and
hittings though I’d never told her).
She said if I just loved people and tried
to make them happy, I’d find in the end
that I had been good. At the bottom
of the letter, just before the kisses, there
was a bit that surprised me very much.
It was lovely; I don’t much like to say
it. Mother said that I’d always been
a good influence and a help to her, even
though I hadn’t tried to be a missionary.
She said that once when she was speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>to Teddy about telling stories (he does
sometimes, you see, because he’s so
little), she said to him that heroes never
told untruths, and he answered at once
and very proudly, “Nor does Molly,
either.”</p>

<p>It did make me feel funny inside.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br>
<small>A FIRST NIGHT</small></h2>
<p class="center">(Reprinted from <i>Little Folks</i> by kind permission)</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I ’LL never do any more plays, never.
It would be all very well if one
could act all the parts oneself, but
making the others learn theirs was
awful. Besides, you wouldn’t believe
that the Corpse could give so much
trouble.</p>

<p>We got it up while Mother was still
away in Algiers, and that was the first
mistake. But we’d often had acting
games before, and I never thought that
this would be so much harder. The
idea of doing it came into my head
one day at lesson time, and it seemed
perfectly splendid, so I pinched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Humphrey directly, and whispered,
“We are going to act a real play with
refreshments and a curtain. I shall
write it.”</p>

<p>I was rather disappointed that
Humphrey didn’t answer, but after a
long time he suddenly said quite loud,
“Like Shakespeare.” Fortunately,
Fräulein didn’t understand. It was
rather silly of him too, because of
course I didn’t mean to make it long
like that. Why, Humph has taken six
months to learn “The Charge of the
Light Brigade,” and he still says, “Half
a leg, half a leg, half a leg onwards”;
besides, I knew that Violet and Ted
would like to come in too.</p>

<p>That afternoon I began to write the
play. I tried at first to make it all up
out of my own head, only when I sat
down nothing seemed to come. So
I thought I’d adapt it out of a
book, like Father says all the best
plays are done nowadays. I took
Aytoun’s “<i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i>.”
I’m very fond of them, you see,
and I know them nearly all by heart,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>but I don’t believe it was me that
loosened the frontispiece as Fräulein says,
just because I took the book to bed
one evening. Not that we read in bed,
because Mother’s very particular about
that, but I like to feel that Dundee and
the Young Pretender are near me all
the night. It was the “<i>Burial March
of Dundee</i>” that I thought would be
the best for the play, but it didn’t seem
to need much adapting, because we could
just have a bier with Ted as Dundee
(he’s the lightest, and his hair is curly).
We three would march on bearing it,
and I’d recite the lay; then we’d march
off again of course.</p>

<p>So, as this was easy, I thought we’d
have another play as well, and I settled
on “<i>Young Lochinvar</i>.” Humphrey
would be Lochinvar; I should have
liked to be the bride, who is the heroine,
of course, but then I settled it would be
better if Violet was, partly because I
thought Mother would have been
pleased at my not being selfish, and
partly because it looks so silly to see the
lady taller than the gentleman, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>when Cousin Sophy was married. Then
I and Ted would be the wicked mother
and father. Of course, he’s heaps
smaller than me, but that didn’t matter
because we’d both be old, and he might
have shrunk quicker. Our old nurse
told us once that she’d got to the time
of life when she was growing downwards
like a cow’s tail; and certainly, when
she came to see us the other day, she did
seem a lot shorter than she used to be
when we were little and she lived with us.</p>

<p>The others were all very pleased with
their parts, and it was settled that the
acting should be on April the 10th,
which is Ted’s birthday, and Fräulein
asked some children to come to tea. It
didn’t leave us very much time, but I
thought it would do, because I never
guessed how slow Humphrey would be.
At each rehearsal he seemed to get
worse, and the dress one was awful.</p>

<p>To begin with, we left it to the very
afternoon of the birthday because the
others said that when the children came,
we could go straight on and needn’t
dress up twice. Only it made me feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>nervous, and then, just as we were
starting, cook sent up word that she
was bothered enough with extra to tea
and couldn’t let us have anything for
the banquet in “<i>Young Lochinvar</i>.” It
was really because there’d been a fuss
about the butcher’s bill; as if we could
help that!</p>

<p>The others were very good, I must
say, and Humphrey said that he’d give
us a Brazil nut that he’d got, and lend
us his peppermint. It’s a most enormous
one, that goes different colours as
you suck, and he keeps it for when he’s
put in the corner. And Violet said
she’d put some of her doll’s sham dishes
on the table; still, that wasn’t very
much for a wedding feast. So I said
perhaps we’d better pretend that they
had had the feast before the curtain
drew up, and there could be just a goblet
of water for Young Lochinvar to quaff.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have been very thirsty
when he had just ‘swum the Esk river,’
and he would enjoy the peppermint
because——” Humphrey began, but I
told him quickly that we wouldn’t have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>any eating or drinking at all, for when
he once begins explaining anything he
never stops. Besides, it was only
because he remembered that he was to
be Young Lochinvar himself.</p>

<p>So we began to dress up, and when
they were all ready, they looked so nice
and real that I began to feel happier.
Humphrey had on my white flannel
pyjamas with a red sash, like we always
have for the hero; they’re rather big for
him, but he wears nightshirts himself, for
though he isn’t very strong, he never
catches cold, and of course you couldn’t
be a hero in a nightshirt. The worst
of it was that it looked rather bare at
the back, because the hero always has
Mother’s fur-lined cape, inside out,
across his shoulders and we hadn’t got
that, nor Mother either, so we began to
feel rather miserable. Even Father was
not there. He had gone out to Mother
for the Easter Holidays.</p>

<p>Violet had on the lace window-curtains
and Mother’s old blue silk dress that
she has given us for dressing-up, and
Teddy wore his pyjamas with a green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>sash, of course, because he was the
villain; at least, he wasn’t exactly a
villain, but he was a very disagreeable and
horrid sort of father for any one to
have. He had on a tow beard, too,
that I made out of some that was over
when Fräulein did the grates, and I’m
sure Mother won’t like them, though
Fräulein does think them so beautiful,
but the beard wasn’t a great success
because it would come off in the middle.</p>

<p>As for me, we didn’t know what to
do, because I’d tied on so many pillows
to be fat, that I knew I couldn’t get on
any one’s dress but cook’s. So we sent
Teddy down to ask her if she would be
so very kind as to lend us one. We
always make Teddy ask for things,
because he’s pretty, and we’ve found out
that helps. I think cook thought he
wanted the dress for himself, for he said
she laughed a lot, but anyway she fetched
him her best one—green stuff, it was,
with red plush trimming.</p>

<p>Then we began. It was awful. Ted
gabbled so that no one could hear him,
and Humphrey had never known his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>part properly, though I used to run into
his room every night after Fräulein had
put out the lights and make him go
through it. He couldn’t escape me
then, but often he was asleep, which
was just as bad, because even if you
woke him up it was no use—he’d be
so stupid. Well, Humphrey seemed to
have forgotten everything he’d ever
known, and the more I went on the
more he forgot until he began to say
the “Charge of the Light Brigade” by
mistake; at last he turned sulky and
wouldn’t speak at all.</p>

<p>Violet knew her part beautifully—I
will say that—and she spoke it very
clearly and slowly, but without the least
bit of expression. When she came to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“With thee I will wander the wide world far,</div>
<div class="verse">For I love thee, dear Mr. Young Lochinvar,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which was a piece that I’d made up
myself, you might have thought she
was saying the multiplication table.</p>

<p>“Can’t you speak it like you really
would to any one?” I said.</p>

<p>“I’d never say such a silly thing,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>she answered, “because trains always
make me sick and you know Mother
says I’d be a dreadful sailor.”</p>

<p>Well, I told her at any rate she ought
to take Young Lochinvar into a corner
and throw her arms round his neck and
kiss him, so that the people could tell
she was pleased to see him; and she did
it, because she’s very obedient, but it
was just as if she were hugging a signpost.</p>

<p>So I said she was a perfect idiot,
which I oughtn’t to have done, however
silly she was, and she began to cry.</p>

<p>Well, I thought we’d better get on to
“Dundee.” It begins—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Sound the fife and cry the slogan,</div>
<div class="indent">Let the pibroch shake the air</div>
<div class="verse">With its wild, triumphal music,</div>
<div class="indent">Worthy of the freight we bear.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>We didn’t know exactly what pibrochs
and all those things were, but we thought
some Burmese gongs and bells of Father’s
would do as well, and we’d brought
them up out of the case in the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>But when I came to look on the
mantelpiece, where I’d put them all
ready, they were gone.</p>

<p>Then Violet, who was still crying,
of course, because she’d been started
off, sobbed out that Fräulein had taken
the things back and had locked up the
case and was very angry. They don’t
belong to Fräulein anyway, so I don’t
see what business it was of hers. But
there we were in a nice fix.</p>

<p>Humphrey said at last that he would
blow his penny whistle. He hasn’t
got any ear at all, and the noise he
makes is more like a railway engine
than anything else; however, I had to
say Yes. Then Teddy suggested that
if we covered up his face he could
do “Nearer, my God, to Thee” on
the comb. Teddy’s the most musical
of us all, but I didn’t think it would
do, because even if the audience didn’t
notice that he was playing his own
funeral march, the comb doesn’t seem
to be quite right somehow. I said we’d
better tie the dinner-bell round Violet’s
waist instead, and she could shake herself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>now and then. Of course she had to
hold up the bier with both her hands,
so she couldn’t do anything else.</p>

<p>We made the bier out of stilts with a
long cushion tied between them, and
then I thought we were ready. So we
lifted it up and Teddy climbed on to
the window-sill and got on to the bier
from there. He lay down and immediately
the strings broke and he went
on to the floor—crash! He shrieked
and roared and he wouldn’t stop, though
I tried to put my arms round him,
because he had come a horrid bang, and
I promised him my old penknife with
half a blade. He thought we’d done it
on purpose, so he’d only scream out,
“Go away! I won’t act—I won’t!
You beast, beast, beast!”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and
we saw—Mother! We all gave one
shout and rushed at her. Ted began
to squeal with joy instead of screaming,
and Violet stopped whimpering, and
Humphrey started off talking quite
fast. As for me—well, it was dreadfully
silly and babyish—but now they’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>all stopped I began to cry. I was so
happy it seemed as if I couldn’t bear
it.</p>

<p>Mother understood, like she always
does. She didn’t say anything, but put
her arm round me tight and let me hide
my face in her cape. The others all
started talking at once, and she kissed
the lump on Teddy’s head and made it
well and said she’d do the bier herself,
so it would be quite safe. She sent
Humphrey down for her fur cape for
Young Lochinvar, and she told us Fräulein
was quite right about our not taking
the musical instruments without leave,
but she was sure Father would let us
have them. And she said—but this
was when I was all right again—that it
wouldn’t matter if Violet couldn’t quite
get the expression, because brides were
always shy and that when she was
married to Father her voice sounded like
some one else talking and without any
expression at all. And then she admired
all our dresses very much and went
downstairs to ask cook to let us have
things for the feast and a bottle of red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>currant wine, which was more grandeur
than we’d ever thought of.</p>

<p>After that everything was different,
like it always is when Mother’s at home.
Oh, I forgot to explain that why we
didn’t expect Mother was that Fräulein
had never got the last letter. Besides,
Mother rather wanted to surprise us.</p>

<p>By this time the other children were
arriving downstairs, and so we started
the acting as soon as we were ready.
Well, you wouldn’t have thought it
after all this fuss, but the plays went
beautifully; every one said so. Certainly
once Teddy opened his eyes as
dead Dundee, and when he saw that
Mother was really sitting there he began
to laugh, but he’s got such a nice laugh
one couldn’t mind much. Mother
shook her head, though she couldn’t
help smiling, so Ted shut up his eyes
tight and screwed up his face all the
rest of the time as though he were
going to sneeze. Humphrey, too, in the
wedding feast stuffed his mouth so full
that he couldn’t speak, but Mother began
to clap, so the people didn’t notice that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>At the end everybody clapped lots
and we all came forward and bowed—at
least Teddy curtseyed by mistake—and
then Mother called out, “Author.
Author and Stage-manager!” and the
others pushed me on alone. I did feel
proud.</p>

<p>All the same, I don’t think I’ll ever
do any more plays—at any rate not
unless Mother is at home all the time,
and of that I’m quite certain.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">
<div class="chapter">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br>
<small>MOTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT really did seem silly of Humphrey
not to have measles with the rest
of us and then to go and catch them
all to himself directly Mother came
home from Algiers. It’s just the sort
of inconvenient thing that Humph
would do—not that he can help it, of
course. I’m sure it wasn’t any fun for
him having it alone.</p>

<p>I must say our measly month last
year was most lovely; Violet and Ted
liked it just as much as me. Besides
having Mother all the time, there was
beef-tea nearly whenever you wanted it
and the most exciting counting every
morning to see who had got the most
spots. The spottiest one was king or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>queen for the day, of course, and the
others had to say “your Majesty” and
bow whenever they spoke. It did seem
grand.</p>

<p>This must have been the most aggravating
thing for Humphrey to think of
afterwards, because when he did go and
catch it, he was so very bad that if he’d
only had it at the same time as us he’d
have easily been king every day. He
was so ill that Mother sent the little
ones away into lodgings with Jane, for
they make too much noise; and as Mrs.
Charlton happened to ask me to stay
with her just then, Mother thought I
might as well go away too. I expect
I ought to say honestly that Mother had
spoken to <i>me</i> about making a noise as
well as to the little ones. It seemed as
if I couldn’t remember about not stumping
upstairs. Once I did think of it,
and I took off my stockings as well as
my shoes, so as to be very quiet, and
went most ’straordinarily slowly, but
then the horrid shoes went and spoilt
it all; they dropped down right from
the very top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Mrs. Charlton is a sort of aunt of
Father’s and she lives up in Lincolnshire.
I didn’t know her at all, though Mother
said I had seen her once when I was a
baby, which is never a very nice sort of
friendship. People like that always tell
you how they held you in their arms,
which makes you feel silly; or else, if
you were too big to nurse, they say how
naughty you used to be. It’s most
uncomfortable. Anyway Mother said
that Mrs. Charlton was a very kind old
lady, though not cuddly; she said, too,
that as I was going on a visit all alone
like a grown-up young lady I must try
and be very good. So I promised, and
even though it mayn’t sound like it
afterwards, I really did try.</p>

<p>There was some talk of Father’s
taking me all the way, but he was too
busy, and it ended in my going to
London with him and then travelling
the rest of the way quite alone! At
least Father did put me in the care of
the guard; I do wish he hadn’t, though
the guard was a very nice man. He
poked in his head at nearly every station
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>and said, “Getting on all right, missy?”
and I said, “Yes, thank you; I hope
you are too.” Then he waved his flag
and we went on again.</p>

<p>It had been directly after lunch when
we left London, but it was getting quite
dark before we got to Corby. I was
most dreadfully starved too, because
I’d eaten all my sandwiches very early.
I thought I’d waited quite a long time
before I began them, but it wasn’t really.
That’s a funny thing about sandwiches,
something seems to make you eat them
almost directly you start, even if you’ve
only just had dinner, and aren’t very
hungry at all.</p>

<p>It was the guard who came and helped
me out with my things at Corby station,
but almost directly a manservant came
up and touched his hat and said, “Miss
Lawrence?” I did feel beautifully
grown up. There was a carriage waiting
outside with a very fat coachman
and two very fat horses; the man took
me to this and held the door open
for me to get in. If only the others
had been with me to see me driving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>all alone in a grand carriage like
that!</p>

<p>Though it was very nice for the
first minute or two, I was so dreadfully
hungry that I couldn’t really enjoy it;
I could only think of roast chickens
and things like that. I did try not to;
I looked out of the window to see the
country and I tied my sash very tight
like the Red Indians, but it wasn’t any
use. It isn’t true either, what they
say in books, that starving people suffer
most from thirst, because I hardly wanted
to drink at all. At last, though, we
did get to the house, and the servant
showed me into the drawing-room,
where Mrs. Charlton was sitting in a
very stiff chair. She got up and kissed
me, and asked me how my Mother and
Father were, but she didn’t seem to
make me feel at all nice. I sat down
in another stiff chair and seemed to get
miserabler and miserabler, I don’t know
why, because they had brought me my
supper, though I’d have liked more. I
was quite glad when Mrs. Charlton
asked me at what hour I went to bed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>which was very funny, because I’d never
wanted people to talk about bedtime
before.</p>

<p>Upstairs, though, it was more miserable
than ever. I never thought paying
visits would feel like that. If even our
cook at home could have come to tuck
me up in her crossest temper, I’d have
been glad. It seemed so dreadful, I
really didn’t know what I should do,
till I thought of Mother’s little penwiper,
that she’d lent me because I
haven’t got one in my writing-case; so
I took that into bed, and cuddled it, and
then I felt better.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up very
early and the sun was shining and it
was all much nicer. I began to read a
book I’d brought from home that was
called “<i>Vanity Fair</i>”; it is an interesting
book, but rather muddly, and the girl
in it, Amelia, is a gump. That’s what
Humphrey and I call people who are
silly like that. I’d read quite a lot by
the time the breakfast bell rang and I
took it down to go on with afterwards.</p>

<p>Mrs. Charlton was sitting in an armchair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>at the head of the table, and all
the servants were there for prayers.
They seemed to be all waiting for me.
Just as if this wasn’t bad enough, the
minute I got in Mrs. Charlton called
out, “What is that book that you have
got in your hand?”</p>

<p>Well, when I showed it to her she
seemed quite cross. She said, “Has
your Mother given you permission to
read this?” in the most severe way. I
said “Yes,” because Mother had never
told us we mayn’t read anything. Then I
thought that as Mother hadn’t mentioned
this particular book, perhaps that wasn’t
true, so I said “No.” Then I remembered
Mother had said once that we
might always take magazines, and this
was on that shelf, so I said “Yes,”
again. I said, “It’s got paper covers,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Don’t prevaricate, child,” Mrs.
Charlton said, “I’m sorry to see you
are not more straightforward.” She
went and locked up my book, which I
did think a shame, and the prayers
began. It was horrid her thinking I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>told stories, and very silly, just when I
was trying to be so partic’larly truthful.</p>

<p>After breakfast we went for a walk in
the village; and that wasn’t bad, only
another unpleasant thing happened first.
I don’t think I said that when I got up,
I tied Mother’s penwiper round my
neck with a bootlace, because that made
me feel nice. Well, when we were
starting to go out Mrs. Charlton suddenly
said, “What is that untidy piece
of black tape showing above your
dress?”</p>

<p>I pretended not to hear. I didn’t
know what else to do, because of
course I couldn’t tell her about private
things like that. She asked me again,
but I still didn’t say anything. Then
she shook her head and said, “Sullen,
sullen,” to herself, though I was just
going away to take the penwiper off so
as to please her. At least I didn’t take
it right off, I tied it round my waist
instead, where the bootlace couldn’t
show, only it was very prickly. It wasn’t
my fault keeping Mrs. Charlton waiting
either, for I had to quite undress to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>it. I forgot to say that it was a very nice
penwiper, that I’d made for Mother as a
birthday present, when I was quite little.
It had “Mother” worked on it in beads,
and the date and how old she was; at
least I’d made a mistake about the last
and put seventy-eight. You see, Father
used to tell us that was Mother’s age for
a joke, and we really believed it. Of
course I was only a little girl then.</p>

<p>The village wasn’t far away, and when
we came back, I played in the garden.
There wasn’t much to do and so I
climbed a tree. Almost directly Mrs.
Charlton came tearing out in a great
fuss and said that it was most dangerous
and unladylike and that I was never to
do such a thing again. I felt very cross,
because really it was a silly little tree
that a baby could climb, but I remembered
what I promised Mother, so I just
walked about in a stupid, grown-up way
and wondered if lunch-time was ever
coming.</p>

<p>In the afternoon it was worse, because
it began to rain. Mrs. Charlton and I
sat in the drawing-room and did nothing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>There was a Persian cat, who you would
think would have been some comfort,
but he was the stupidest cat I ever saw.
He just slept the whole time. Mrs.
Charlton asked me then if I hadn’t got
any needlework, so I went and fetched
the mat that I’m working for Cousin
Sophy’s wedding present. (It will be
rather late, because Cousin Sophy went
and got married about a year ago, before
I could get it done; I do think she
needn’t have been in such a hurry.) I
sat there and sewed for ages and ages
until I thought my head would drop
off; at last I found I’d forgotten to
bring the skein of the silk, and I
couldn’t do any more. That was nice.</p>

<p>Tea came just then, real afternoon tea,
with thin bread and butter and two very
nice little scone things on a separate
plate and a little jug of cream, that I’m
partic’larly fond of. Well, I tried not
to be greedy, but I couldn’t help being
rather pleased, when suddenly Mrs.
Charlton said, “Pussy is so fond of
cream, I know you won’t mind his
having it,” and she crumbled up both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>the little scones and poured all the cream
over them, every drop. Then she asked
me to put it down on the floor in the
corner.</p>

<p>After tea Mrs. Charlton asked me
if I’d like to read a little, because she
said she’d look out a nice suitable book
for me. I was very pleased, even
though I found it was a book with a
shiny red cover and green leaves on it,
which sort generally aren’t interesting.
It was called “<i>How Little Susan Saved
the Home</i>,” and it was all about poor
people.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a bad sort of book, though
it was written rather as if you had got
no sense at all. It was about a little
girl who used to wait outside the public-house
every night to come home with
her father. I don’t see that that was so
horrid for her. When we were in
London, the Punch and Judy shows
were almost always at public-house
corners, and once we saw a dear fat dog
in a patchwork coat and the darlingest
white mice on his back, but Cousin
Sophy would never let us stop. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>course on wet nights it can’t have been
such fun for Little Susan, but I dare say
they’d have let her wait inside, only she
seemed to be too silly to ask. In the
middle of the book there was a very
horrible bit, about the father getting
tipsy and kind of mad, but he got all
right at the end. It was in such big
print I soon finished it, because I read
very quickly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Charlton had gone off to sleep,
so I didn’t know what to do. I looked
at the bookcase, but it was locked, so I
walked round the room, and there in the
back drawing-room, rather high up, was
a shelf with some old-looking books on
it. I went up to Mrs. Charlton to ask
her if I might take one, but she was still
asleep. Well, I didn’t really think she’d
mind, because they were so shabby, so I
climbed up on a chair and chose one
called “<i>Peregrine Pickle</i>”; I thought
from the name it might be about a boy
who got into scrapes. It was rather disappointing
inside, and the s’s were funny
and difficult to read, but bits were interesting.
It was written in a nice way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>too, not sillily like “<i>Little Susan</i>,” and
there weren’t any horrid parts in it either.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I was reading, the book
was snatched out of my hand. Mrs.
Charlton was standing there looking
furious. “How dare you take that
book, you wicked girl!” she said; “go
to your room and pray for a better
nature.” I told her that I only took it
because I’d finished the one that she
gave me, and I didn’t know what to do
till she woke, but she didn’t seem to
believe me; it did seem curious and
horrid.</p>

<p>I went upstairs as she told me, and it
was so dull that I said the multiplication
table three times forwards and once backwards,
and before that I’d repeated
nearly all the poetry I knew, besides
trying to reckon out how much the
horse’s shoe would cost if you paid a
farthing for the first nail and doubled it
for each one. Of course I pretended I
was in the Bastille all the time, but there
weren’t any rats or toads or anything
nice, and I was quite glad even to see
the housemaid. It wasn’t the real housemaid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>either, because she was old, and
disagreeable; this was one I hadn’t seen
before. She brought me some bread
and milk for my supper.</p>

<p>“I dare say you’re missing your little
brothers and sisters,” she said.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought of it before, but
directly she said it, I knew that that was
why I was so miserable. I seemed suddenly
to want Mother and them all so
dreadfully, that I could hardly help
crying. Lizzie (the servant told me
that was her name, and that she was
the hupandowngirl, not the housemaid),
well, she was most nice; she seemed
the nicest person in the house. She
said she used to cry herself to sleep
every night when she first went out to
service. She told me about her home
too, and that there were twelve of them,
and that they used to sleep four in one
bed, and lovely things like that. She
was just telling me about her pigs, when
the bell rang rather angrily.</p>

<p>“Lor, I must be off, the Missus will
be in a fine taking,” Lizzie said, and she
ran away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>When Lizzie had gone, I was just
going to be miserable, but suddenly
she rushed in again, and threw a lot of
newspaper things on to the bed. “I
thought maybe they’d amuse you, but
don’t let the Missus see ’em,” she said,
and she tore out, because the bell was
ringing more crossly than ever.</p>

<p>I certainly did know that I oughtn’t to
read books when I’d been sent upstairs
in disgrace, and I’d better confess that
at once. But then it didn’t feel to me
that I’d done anything to be punished
for, and it did seem so tempting. First
I thought I’d just look at the pictures—for
there was one on each cover—of
gentlemen shooting each other and
ladies in their dressing-gowns, with their
hair down, and things like that, all most
exciting. So I began just to turn over
the leaves to see the names of the people
in the pictures, but before I knew what
I was doing I was reading one story
straight through. I truthfully forgot
then about it’s being naughty.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting story, all
about lords and dukes; I had never read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>one like it before. They were most
funny people, and always getting fond
of quite strangers and wanting to fly
with them. I was just in the middle,
when suddenly I heard the door open.
Before I could think, I’d pushed all the
papers under the eiderdown. That was
the part Mother minded most when I
told her, because it seemed mean. I’ve
tried to think since that I did it because
Lizzie had asked me not to let any one
see the papers, but it wasn’t that really,
at least not mostly. Besides, what
Mother said was that if I had put away
the novelettes at the beginning without
looking at them, and then have given
them back to Lizzie at the first opportunity,
that would have saved her getting
into trouble just the same, and I
should not have been mean.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose when Mrs. Charlton
came in I looked rather uncomfortable;
also there may have been a bit of one of
the papers sticking out. Anyway, the
first thing she did was to lift up the
eiderdown. Then of course she saw
them all. I felt awful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>No one said anything for what
seemed a long time, and then Mrs.
Charlton made a horrid noise in her
throat and began: “You are so utterly
deceitful,” she said, “that it is not of
very much use to put questions to you,
but I should be glad if you would kindly
inform me where you procured this degrading
form of literature.”</p>

<p>I didn’t answer. That wasn’t naughtiness,
but because of Lizzie. Mrs.
Charlton asked me again, and she asked
me other questions of the same sort, but
of course I couldn’t answer them either.
She got angrier and angrier. At last
she said, “I shall send you home immediately.
I cannot have my household
corrupted by your low tastes and deceitfulness.”</p>

<p>That was the first nice thing she had
said since I had been there. Of course
I didn’t altogether like it, because it
seemed horrid to be sent home in disgrace;
besides, my coming back would
be a worry for them, when Humph was
so ill. But I was so happy at the idea
of seeing Mother again that I couldn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>really think of anything else. I could
hardly help jumping, I was so happy.
I said, “Please, shall I put on my coat
and hat at once?”</p>

<p>I’m sure I said it most politely, but
Mrs. Charlton replied “No” most
angrily. She said, “You may certainly
rest assured that I do not wish to keep
you a moment longer than I am compelled,
but I am afraid that it would
be impossible for me to arrange for
your return to-night.” Then she went
away.</p>

<p>After she had gone I thought a lot.
First of all I packed my box, so as to be
ready the first thing in the morning.
Then I suddenly thought, Why couldn’t
I arrange my journey home all alone, so
as not to bother Mrs. Charlton? Then
I could start off directly? I rushed to
the window to see if it had stopped raining,
and it had.</p>

<p>When I began to plan it out it seemed
to get easier and easier. It was only
three and a half miles to the station, and
along the big road with milestones and
telegraph posts all the way. I knew, because,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>besides driving up the day before,
we’d gone along a bit of the road to the
village that morning. I’d got my return
ticket to King’s Cross in my purse,
and once that I got there I’d just take a
cab to Waterloo, and then I could get
home quite well. I know all about the
trains from there, you see, because I’ve
been lots of times. I’d got plenty of
money, because there was the half-crown
that Mother gave me before I came
away (I had sewed it into my clothes, of
course, like people do for travelling).
Then I’d got a shilling and a farthing
from my pocket-money, and a sixpence
with a hole in it; I knew that with all
that I could manage quite well. The
only bother was about my box: I
couldn’t carry it, of course; it <i>was</i>
puzzling. I thought, though, I might
tell them at the station to call for it the
next day, and let it go by itself, like we
sometimes do at home. I wrote the
address on the label in printing very
neatly.</p>

<p>I thought then that I’d start off,
though I did feel a little uncomfortable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>as to whether Mother would mind.
She certainly doesn’t like me to go out
alone, but sometimes I have been sent on
a message. Of course it was getting
rather late, but I thought if I ran I
could get to Corby, where the station is,
before it got quite dark. Besides, I
knew Mother wouldn’t wish me to stop
when Mrs. Charlton didn’t want me; I
heard her say once herself that visitors
should never outstay their welcome.
The chiefest thing, though, was that I
felt I just couldn’t go a whole night
more without seeing Mother.</p>

<p>The worst part to think of was the
going downstairs. My heart was
thumping dreadfully by the time I had
got on my coat and hat. Oh, first I
pinned a little note on to the pincushion
to say that I’d gone. It was most useful
that I’d read Lizzie’s book, because
that is what Lady Vera did before she
flew with the Duke; I mightn’t ever
have thought of it by myself. I forgot
to say that I’d tied up all the magazines
in a piece of brown paper and addressed
them to “Miss Lizzie Hupandowngirl,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>thankyou.” I had to put just that because
I didn’t know her other name.</p>

<p>It was perfectly awful—the going
down I mean. The stairs seemed to
creak just as if they were doing it on
purpose. Every minute I thought
some one would come. No one did,
though. I expect Mrs. Charlton was
having her late dinner; anyway, there
was nobody about. I crept across the
hall and opened the front door. The
squeak it made was dreadful. I stood
there for a minute feeling quite sick and
funny, but still no one came. So I went
out and shut the door behind me as
softly as I could. Then I ran and
ran.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn’t run all the way
to Corby; I had to go slower pretty
soon. I kept running little bits now
and then, but it seemed a dreadfully
long way. I was so afraid that some
one Mrs. Charlton knew would see me
and perhaps send me back, but though
the people I met looked at me in rather
a surprised way, they didn’t speak. I
hid behind the hedge, too, until they’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>passed, when I heard them coming in
time.</p>

<p>It was getting quite dark for the last
part of the way, and the lamps were all
lit at Corby. I couldn’t remember the
turning to the station, but I asked a
little boy. They speak so funnily up
there that I didn’t understand what
he said, but he pointed out the way
all right.</p>

<p>There was only one porter person at
the station, and I was rather glad of
that. He seemed rather stupid, but
when I’d asked him two or three times,
he said there was a train to King’s Cross
at 8.52. That was very lucky, because
it was already a quarter past eight.
The porter asked me if I had got any
luggage, but I said, “No, you are to
fetch that to-morrow.” I didn’t think
until afterwards that I hadn’t told him
the address.</p>

<p>When the train came it was very full,
because there had been an excursion or
something. I found one compartment
that wasn’t quite so full, and I got in.
A gentleman said, “Come on, there’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>room for a little ’un,” and another said,
“The more the merrier.” They certainly
were very merry, for they were
singing songs the whole time, and fighting,
but all in fun. I didn’t know
grown-up people played like that.</p>

<p>There was a very fat lady sitting
opposite me, and she began to talk.
She said suddenly in rather a strict way,
“Where’s your Ma, my dear?” and I
said, “At home.”</p>

<p>After a minute or two she started
again. She said, “Ain’t your Ma
well?”</p>

<p>I said, “Yes, it’s Humph who is ill.”
Then she asked me some more about
him, and I told her.</p>

<p>I thought she’d stopped, and I quite
jumped when she said very crossly, “I
suppose your Pa won’t leave ’is smoke.
Puff an’ pull the whole day long, that’s
the way with all these men. Pigs, I
calls ’em!”</p>

<p>I didn’t exactly understand. I said,
“Father doesn’t smoke the whole day,
but he is very fond of it. He likes to
have his pipe if he can.” I found out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>afterwards that she thought I meant that
Father was in a smoking compartment
of the same train; I’m sure I don’t
know why. I’d got so sleepy, though,
that I didn’t seem to be able to explain
anything or think properly at all.</p>

<p>There was a funny little thin man
sitting next to the fat lady, who looked
as if he’d got there by mistake. He
was like a white rabbit with a cold in its
head. Suddenly the fat lady said,
“Jeremiah, change places this minute
with the young lady,” and he jumped up
in quite a frightened way. Then she
said to me much more nicely, “You
come an’ set ’ere, my dear, then you’ll
be able to lean up aginst me an’ rest
yourself more comfortable like.”</p>

<p>I was so sleepy that I could hardly
stand. It was most peculiar. So the
fat lady pulled me up and put my head
on her lap, just as if I were a baby; I
didn’t seem to mind at all. I was rather
ashamed when I thought about it afterwards,
but Mother says it didn’t matter,
and that the fat lady was most kind. I
think so, too, though her lap was rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>steep to be very comfortable. All the
same, I must have gone off to sleep
almost directly.</p>

<p>The next thing I remember was being
lifted up. The fat lady and the little
white-rabbit gentleman were bustling
about getting down their things, and the
train was stopping. “No, this ain’t
King’s Cross, my dear,” she said, “but
we ain’t far off, so you jist pop on your
’at. We gets out ’ere, but I suppose your
Pa will come for you at the next station.
I’d like to give my fine gentleman a
piece of my mind,” she went on to the
little rabbit man, “leaving that pore
child in ’ere an’ never so much as taking
the trouble to clap ’is eyes upon ’er the
’ole blessed way.”</p>

<p>I was so astonished altogether, I could
hardly speak. You see, for the first
minute or two I couldn’t remember
where I was. So I just said, “Thank
you very much, thank you,” a good
many times over. The fat lady bent
down and kissed me, and said, “There’s
a good little girl.” And, do you know,
when her face was close, it looked for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>minute like Mother’s. It was most astonishing,
because she was so red and
funny.</p>

<p>I got quite awake getting my hat
down from the rack, and almost directly
after we arrived at King’s Cross. There
was a great rush and bustle, and only
one or two cabs, so it’s lucky the other
excursion people didn’t all want them;
every one seemed to be walking. I
thought I’d better make haste, though,
so I said to one cabman, “Are you
engaged?” and when he said “No,” I
jumped in quickly.</p>

<p>Well, I expected that he’d start at
once, but he didn’t. I waited a minute
or two, then I poked open the little
hole, which is rather difficult to do
because it’s so high. I said, “Will you
tell your horse to go, please?”</p>

<p>He looked most astonished. He said,
“You ain’t all alone?” I said “Yes.”
Then he was very cross. He said
“Come, now, get out of this.” I remembered
then that I hadn’t told him
where to go to, and I thought that
might be making him so disagreeable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>I said, “I beg your pardon for not telling
you that I want to go to Waterloo
Station, and I want to start at once,
please.”</p>

<p>The man seemed to get more surprised
still. He said (I can’t help it,
it’s sounding dreadful, but it’s what he
really did say)—he said, “Well, I’m
blessed!” Then he called out to a
porter, but the porter was too busy to
hear him.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do because he
didn’t seem to be even beginning to
start. Then I remembered that when
we were at Cousin Sophy’s the cabman
wouldn’t drive us back from the pantomime
because he said Chiswick was too
far. So I poked open the little hole
again, and I said, “You are on the rank
plying for hire, and unless you start
immediately I shall summons you.”
That was what Cousin Sophy said;
Humph and I have often acted it since,
because the cabman was so angry and
there was such an exciting fuss.</p>

<p>This cabman wasn’t angry, though;
he just seemed to get more and more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>astonished. He began to laugh, and he
said again, “Well, I’m blessed!”
Then he said, “You ain’t running
away, are you, Missy?”</p>

<p>I said “No.” I think that was true,
because it isn’t exactly running away
when you have been told that you are
to go the next day in any case. I said,
“I am just travelling home to my
Mother.”</p>

<p>That seemed to decide him more.
He was going to start, when he thought
of something else to worry over. He
called down, “But ’ow about my fare,
Missy?”</p>

<p>I had been rather troubled about that
myself. I’d got the half-crown for him,
of course, and the ticket home from
Waterloo is only one-and-five-pence-halfpenny,
so he could have another
halfpenny out of the sixpence with the
hole in it, as well as my bright farthing.
But I wasn’t sure if even all that was
enough. Cabs are so dreadfully expensive,
Mother always says; and Father
says one oughtn’t to be stingy. So I
just explained it to the cabman. I said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“I’ve got half-a-crown for you, and a
halfpenny out of the sixpence with a
hole in it, and a bright farthing; and if
you’ll drive me as far as you can for
that without me being stingy, I’ll walk
the rest.” I knew there couldn’t be
very much further to go, anyway.</p>

<p>The cabman, though, was most nice.
He said, “The ’alf-crown will do nicely
for me, Missy. You can keep the rest.”
Then we really did drive off.</p>

<p>I did like it in the cab, and the streets
were all bright with the lights. A clock
we passed said it was ten minutes to
twelve; wasn’t that an astonishing time?
When we got to Waterloo I jumped
out and gave the cabman his money.
He said, “Shall you find the lady all
right?” I said “Yes.” I think he
would have said more, only just at that
minute some one waved to him from the
opposite side of the road.</p>

<p>There weren’t very many people in
the station, but they all stared very
rudely, and some looked as if they were
going to speak. So I hurried on as fast
as I could to the place where you get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>the tickets. I knew there was a train in
the middle of the night, you see, because
Father comes down by it sometimes
after parties. The little window for
buying the tickets was open. (I can
reach up to it quite easily on tiptoe;
Humphrey can’t, he’d have to take a
footstool if he travelled alone.) I said,
“One half-third single to Farncombe.”</p>

<p>Well, the gentleman there looked as
surprised as the cabman. He said
“What?” quite crossly. I thought it
was because I hadn’t said “please,” but
he wasn’t a bit nicer when I did. Then
some other people came near, and that
seemed to make the gentleman in the
little hole less surprised. He punched
my ticket and gave it to me, and he
said, “I suppose your Mother has a
season ticket?” I said, “No, Father
has.” I didn’t know why he asked,
but I think now he thought that I belonged
to the people who were standing
there. It was very silly of him, for the
lady wasn’t the least bit like Mother;
she looked horrid.</p>

<p>I know the platform from which our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>trains mostly start, besides a good many
other people were going along as well.
I heard one lady say, “Who does that
little girl belong to?” And the gentleman
said, “Oh, to that lot, I think.” It
made me very cross that everybody
should mistake the horrid lady for
Mother, but I didn’t like to explain.
Somebody else, too, asked me if I were
lost, but I said, very hard, “No.”</p>

<p>It was so uncomfortable, people talking
to me like this, that I got into the
first empty carriage that I saw. I got
under the seat, too, so that they’d be
less likely to bother me with questions.
It isn’t nice when every one is
so astonished and cross at you.</p>

<p>I liked it under the seat, but I was
so afraid that it was naughty. I did
hope that Mother wouldn’t mind. You
see, she always says that I am so careless
about my clothes, and that it is unkind
to Violet, who has to wear them when
I have grown out of them. It does
seem hard on Violet, certainly, because
she never spoils anything herself. I think
she’d look neat on a desert island. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>really ought to have been born an eldest.
It made it worse, too, because I was
wearing my titums. I suppose every one
knows that a titums is your middle-best
dress; the others are hitums and scrub.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t stop under the
seat all the time, or else I might have
passed the station. I thought afterwards
that it was lucky no one got into the
carriage, because grown-up people are so
easily astonished, and they might have
thought it funny when I came crawling
out. We only stopped twice before we
got to Farncombe, which made it easier,
and I had lots of time to plan what I’d
do when we got there. First of all,
though, I tried if both doors of the
compartment were unlocked, because
that was part of the plan. They were.
I began to feel like the Young Pretender
after Culloden.</p>

<p>Well, it all went beautifully. As the
train slowed down to go into Farncombe
Station I jumped out of the door on the
other side to our platform. Then I ran
across the line and crouched down by
the hedge until the train had gone off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>again and everything was quiet. I did
this because the station-master and all
the people at Farncombe know us, and
I thought there’d be more fuss. Besides,
the station-master is a most disagreeable
man.</p>

<p>I knew there was a hole in the hedge
just there, because Humph and I discovered
it one day when Fräulein took
us to meet Mother; she’d missed her
train, and so we had to wait a long
time. It wasn’t true, though, that
Humph and I first made that hole, like
the station-master said; it was there all
the time, though it may have got a
teeny bit larger, but then holes are
things that grow fast, like in sheets, but
’specially with woollen gloves. Anyway
it was a good thing now that it had got
big, because I was able to find it quite
easily and to scramble through into the
field. Nobody saw me, so after waiting
a few minutes more I walked across and
got over the stile into the road.</p>

<p>I had quite forgotten that it would be
dark for this walk, when I planned to
come home at Mrs. Charlton’s. If I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>had remembered, I might not have
started, because of thinking that Mother
would not like it, but I should never
have guessed that it would be so horrid
in itself. It wasn’t pitch black either,
like it sometimes is. I’m not sure it
wasn’t worse, because it was light
enough to see all sorts of dreadful black
things all round, and once you get quite
outside Farncombe there aren’t any
more lights or houses at all. It was so
quiet, too, there wasn’t a sound. All at
once I began to think of mad dogs and
St. Denis. I thought, suppose there was
some one coming after me, holding his
head in his hands and looking down at
it with his bleeding neck, like in the
picture. I wanted to run dreadfully,
but I wouldn’t let myself, because if you
once start, something seems to come
after you that will clutch you with long,
clawy fingers if you stop. I thought
of Mother instead, as hard as ever I
could, and I’d got the penwiper on
still, so I held that through my clothes.
That made it rather better.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw something in the road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>moving. I could hardly breathe. It
was awful. But then it came nearer,
and I saw it was just an ordinary man.
He had on his head quite all right.
He said “Hullo!” and I said “Good-evening.”</p>

<p>I didn’t think he was a very nice
man, though; for he came up quite
close in rather a rude way. He caught
hold of me and said, “That’s a nice
brooch you’ve got on,” and I said,
“Yes; Father gave it to me last
birthday. It’s real gold.”</p>

<p>The man didn’t answer because just
then we heard wheels coming. He listened
for a minute and then he dashed
away into the bushes. The carriage
was really on the upper road, so he
needn’t have minded. I didn’t tell that
to him, because I didn’t like him much.
It was kind of him, though, to admire
my brooch. He was only a common
sort of man, so I dare say he’d never
been taught manners and things.</p>

<p>I felt much better and more comfortable
after meeting the man. I got
almost directly to where our short cut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>through the copse begins, and that made
it seem more like home. I thought that
I could let myself begin to run there,
because it’s such a little way, but all the
same I did feel frightened before I got
to the house. I rushed up to the front
door and tugged at the handle. It was
locked!</p>

<p>Well, of course, I might have known
that it would be, but at the time it
seemed the worst thing of all. I began
screaming out “Mother, Mother!” and
I was all shaking and crying, I don’t
know why. Almost before you’d have
thought there was time, the door was
pulled back and Mother had hold of
me.</p>

<p>After that it was all right, of course,
and almost too nice to tell. Mother
had come running down just as she was,
though she said afterwards that she
hadn’t really believed that it could be
me, and had thought that she was
dreaming it all. She carried me up and
undressed me and put me into her own
bed. I was still rather silly, for I didn’t
seem to be able to say anything, only a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>line I’d read kept going on inside my
head about “Port after stormy seas.”</p>

<p>Presently, though, Mother began to
ask me questions. She kept asking me
if I had really come all the way alone, as
if she could hardly believe it. Each
time I said “Yes” she cuddled me
again. Then she asked me if Mrs.
Charlton knew; so I ’splained about it.
Mother didn’t say anything hardly then,
but she wrote a telegram for Mrs.
Charlton to say that I’d arrived safely,
and she put it for the gardener to take
to the post-office the first thing in the
morning. Mother got me some milk,
and some cake, which I ate while she
went in for a minute to see Humph. I
forgot to say that of course I’d asked
about him at the beginning, and Mother
said that he had got much better the
last day. Fräulein was with him, so
Mother didn’t have to stay. She came
back to me, and I was so happy it
seemed to make me sleepy all at once.
It was almost too lovely to feel that
Mother was quite close to me.</p>

<p>The next day it wasn’t so nice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>though. Mother talked to me a long
time, and she said a thing that made me
feel dreadfully bad; she said I’d been
selfish; I’d thought of my own feelings
but not of other people’s. She said that
fortunately Mrs. Charlton had not discovered
my absence until the next
morning, but if she had done so she
would have been extremely worried,
and, at her age, it might have made her
quite ill. Also she’d have telegraphed
home, and Mother says had she known
that I was wandering about the country
by myself all night, she could hardly
have borne it, especially when Humphrey
was so ill and Father away. I
minded that part much more than about
Mrs. Charlton. Mother looked so unhappy,
it was dreadful. I promised and
promised I’d never do such a thing
again.</p>

<p>That wasn’t all the disagreeables
either. The next day a letter came
from Cousin Sophy in London, asking
me and the little ones to stay with her.
She’d been abroad before, and so had
only just heard of Humph’s having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>measles. Well, Mother wrote to Jane,
who was away in lodgings with the little
ones, to tell her to take them to Cousin
Sophy’s at the end of the week, because
Mother knew that they’d like it better.
But with regard to me, Mother said she
hardly liked to trust me away from
home again.</p>

<p>I minded the not being trusted part,
but I didn’t mind the not going so
much when Mother told me, because it
seemed so nice to stop at home with her.
But it wasn’t really; it was a great deal
horrider than I could have ’magined. I
hardly saw Mother at all because she
was looking after Humphrey all the time,
and I wasn’t allowed to go in to him.
As for Fräulein, she was most strict and
disagreeable. And then when Violet
wrote she said that Cousin Sophy had
taken them to the Zoo and the Chamber
of Horrors, and lots of other lovely
places. I did feel cross.</p>

<p>They are back now, though, and
Humph is well, and everything is nice.
I’ve quite settled not to go visiting
strangers alone again—no, not as long as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>I live. The others are so interested in
my adventures, though, that it almost
makes one forget how horrid they
really were. Perhaps the lovely things
you read in books are really like that,
and even being a cowboy mayn’t be
always nice. And I do think a journey
like mine would be too dreadful for any
one if Mother weren’t waiting for them
at the end of it.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.
</div><div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
