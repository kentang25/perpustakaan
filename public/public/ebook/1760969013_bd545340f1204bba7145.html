<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The plan of arrangement used in this book has in view a combination
of the recitation and lecture systems, and affords an opportunity for
teachers to apply the best principles of both. The paragraph headings
should be thoroughly fixed in mind and close attention should be given
to the words in heavy type and Italics that occur in the body of a
paragraph; together they form a convenient outline for the lesson. The
questions at the end of each lesson are to be used to test the pupils’
mastery of the lesson material; all available works of reference should
be consulted for fuller information than the limited space of one book
will admit of, each member of the class preparing one or more abstracts
to be read before the class. The review outlines and suggestions are
to be used in the same way, special attention being given to written
answers such as would be required in an examination.</p>
<p>With a view of furnishing the reader a considerable amount of material
on the <i>growth</i> of music as an art, biographical sketches have
been made short, especially since so many excellent works of that
description are available at a small price. Emphasis has been laid on
the work of the men who developed music, on the influences which shaped
their careers and the permanent value of their contributions to music.
A clear knowledge of how music reached its present state is not to be
had by studying books, biographical and critical; the <i>works</i> of the
composers must be examined, played and sung, compared, analyzed as to
methods of construction (Form) and expression (Melody, Harmony and
Rhythm), so that the student may appreciate the change from simple,
elementary processes to the free, polyphonic style found in the complex
modern piano and orchestral scores. Reference is made to representative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
compositions by classical and modern composers, which are part of the
average teaching repertoire. The works of the earlier composers are
not, however, readily accessible, although good examples of the style
of the 16th and 17th centuries are in the cheap editions of Peters,
Litolff, Augener, Breitkopf and Härtel, and Ricordi.</p>
<p>The plan of this book provides for two lessons a week for thirty weeks.
This will occupy a school year and allow time for quizzes, reviews and
examinations. If more time is available, the work may be divided into
four, five or six terms and stress laid on the study of representative
compositions, the preparation of short papers on the suggested topics,
adding, as a feature to interest friends and music lovers generally,
public programs including music.</p>
<p>Musical clubs will find in this book material for several years’
programs, special attention having been given to the lessons on modern
composers and their music, the suggestions as to class-work applying
with equal force to the study classes of clubs. The individual reader
should follow out the suggested historical and biographical parallels
which help so strongly to fix in the mind the periods in which
composers lived.</p>
<p>Lessons III to VI were prepared by Dr. H. A. Clarke, of the University
of Pennsylvania; Lessons VIII to XIV by Mr. Arthur L. Judson, of
Denison University; Lessons XV and XVI by Mr. Preston Ware Orem, Mus.
Bac., of Philadelphia; Lessons XVII to XIX, XXI to XXIII, XXXVII to
XL by Mr. Frederic S. Law, of Philadelphia; Lessons XXV to XXXIII by
Mr. Clarence G. Hamilton, A. M., of Wellesley College; Lessons XLI to
XLVIII by Mr. Edward Burlingame Hill, A. B., of Boston; Lessons L to
LVI by Mr. Arthur Elson, of Boston.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><b>Purpose of the Study of the History of Music</b>.—The purpose of
the study of the history of music is to trace the development of the
many phases which make up modern music which we cannot but regard as a
great social force, an intellectual, an uplifting force. If we consider
it from the material side, it is one of magnitude; we need but think of
the money invested in buildings, opera houses, schools, concert halls,
publishing plants, factories, the sums spent on musical instruments,
instruction, concerts, opera, etc., to recognize the commercial
side. When we think of the great army of persons whose livelihood is
conditioned upon musical work, upon the great audiences that support
musical enterprises, we recognize the magnitude of music in a social
sense, and that it offers a large field for study. These conditions,
interesting as they are, represent only phases of musical work, not
Music itself, and serve to show the place which Music occupies in the
life of today. Our investigation is, then, a consideration of the
origin and development of Music, and the means by which it took shape.</p>
<p><b>The Place of Intellect in Music</b>.—When we think of Music we have
in mind an organization of musical sounds into something definite,
something by design, not by chance, the product of the working of
the human mind with musical sounds and their effects upon the human
sensibilities. So long as man accepted the various phenomena of musical
sounds as isolated facts, there could be no art. But when he began
to use them to minister to his pleasure and to study them and their
effects, he began to form an art of music. The story of music is the
record of a series of attempts on the part of man to make artistic use
of the material which the ear accepts as capable of affording pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and as useful in expressing the innermost feelings. The raw material
of music consists of the sounds considered musical, the human voice,
various musical instruments and the use of this material in such ways
as to affect the human sensibilities; that is, to make an impression
upon the hearer which shall coincide with that of the original maker
of the music who gives to his feelings expression in music. We find
in music, as in other branches, that man tries to reduce phenomena
to order and to definite form. The mass of musical material is
vague, incoherent, disorganized. Man seeks to devise ways to use it
intelligibly, and to promote esthetic pleasure. If musical sounds are
to be combined simultaneously or successively, this combination should
be in accordance with design, not haphazard, just as the builder of the
house or the temple puts together his material according to a regular
plan. Those who have been leaders in the Art of Music have labored in
two ways: to <i>extend</i> the limits of expression in music, and to find
the means to <i>contain</i> that expression. At one period stress is laid
on making music expressive, at another on the medium for conveying
expression to others, the latter being comprehended in the term Form.
In connection with this statement, the student will do well to remember
that every period of great intellectual activity, social or political,
reacted upon music and the other arts; to illustrate, we need but refer
to the formal, even artificial character of the music of the period
preceding the French Revolution and the freedom and vigor imparted by
the spirit of Romanticism which followed in the wake of that great
political movement, a difference strikingly illustrated in the music of
Haydn and Beethoven, Clementi and Schumann. There is also a constant
action and reaction of the various racial streams of power such as
the Aryan on the Semitic, East upon the West, Latin upon the Teuton,
Folk-music upon the Scholastic.</p>
<p><b>The Principles in Music</b>.—The leading principles in music are:
Rhythm, Melody, Harmony, Color or Tone Quality, and in the execution of
works of music, Dynamic Contrast, an essential factor in Expression.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
For ages after the birth of Music, Rhythm and Melody were the only real
elements, Rhythm being first recognized. The potency of Rhythm, strong
and irresistible in the early days of the race and with primitive man,
is still acknowledged. Music that lacks a clearly-defined rhythm does
not move the masses. Witness martial music, the dance airs and the
“popular song.” All primitive languages were characterized by concise,
figurative and picturesque qualities; they easily changed from the
ordinary into the lofty and the impassioned. Intonation and changing
inflection had much to do with meaning, as is the case with the Chinese
language of today. Historians ascribe the origin of Melody to this
principle of vocal expression. For years prior to the Christian Era,
and long after, Rhythm and Melody were the only accepted elements of
Music, and the art remained in a low grade of development. It was not
until Harmony appeared, clear and unmistakable, that Music was able to
claim a position equal to that accorded to the sister-arts, Poetry,
Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. These principles, Rhythm, Melody
and Harmony, became, when couched in the forms of expression adopted by
the great masters, what we call Modern Music, and the story is one of
a development from extreme simplicity to the complexity illustrated in
modern orchestral scores.</p>
<p><b>Means of Expression</b>.—One more phase must be mentioned here,
the means used to present to others the thoughts or feelings of the
composer, that is, the human voice and its artistic use, instruments
of various kinds, their primitive forms and gradual development, their
use singly and in combination with other instruments. This phase is
peculiarly associated with modern music; for it was not until the art
had freed itself from the fetters imposed by vocal music, that absolute
music, availing itself of perfected instruments, came into its own.
From that time development was unprecedentedly rapid.</p>
<p><b>What is to be Brought Forward</b>.—The history of Music is, then,
a recital of facts bearing upon the development of modern music and we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
shall lay stress on such facts as show a permanent impress and a solid
contribution to progress in one or more of the lines marked out: Form,
Expression, Melody, Rhythm, Harmony and Instrumental Color. In the
study of a composer, the facts essential to the history of music are
critical rather than biographical; not a life chronicle so much as a
clear statement of what he specially contributed to forward the art.
To gain an educational value, the facts of the history of music are
to be studied so as to glean from them their significance, and an
understanding of the causes and conditions which made them possible;
then we go on to discern the consequences to which they in turn gave
rise. No man works for himself and out of himself. He builds upon what
others have done, and he builds for others. The student should discern
the lesson in the past, and receive guidance for the future.</p>
<p><b>What We Learn from Archæology</b>.—The history of an art such as
Music must give the historical data in connection with the development
of art and artists, free of all questionable and false features, and
give as trustworthy, as accurate a picture of the various stages as
possible. If we go backward in our research we reach a point at which
ordinary records fail. If we make an inquiry into the beginnings of
music we must have recourse to the findings and interpretations of
Archæology. The results are by no means satisfactory. In all the
digging in the ruins of the once great cities of Egypt, and Western
Asia, and of Greece and Etruria as well, with perhaps one exception,
no music has been brought to light, and but a few instruments, and
these can scarcely be considered perfect. However, the pictorial
representations on tombs, monuments, temples and houses give valuable
aid, enabling scholars to reconstruct the story of music among the
older civilizations. We must not forget, however, that conjecture
plays a more or less prominent part in all the translations of the old
hieroglyphic and cuneiform writings. We have no direct knowledge of the
scales used or how the instruments were played together, what was the
nature of the science and system in use. What we have is mere inference
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
from the nature of the instruments and the representations of musicians
playing their instruments, together with fragments from contemporary or
later writings.</p>
<p><b>What We Learn from Ethnology</b>.—Another source open to students
of the beginnings of music is the material gathered by Ethnology. Those
who place stress on this means of research lay down the proposition
that the primitive people of the world of today occupy a mental
and social stage similar to that of the primitive races from which
the civilized folk of today have sprung. Therefore, they study the
music, the rude chants, the dances, the instruments, etc., of various
primitive tribes, and then by comparison try to indicate the various
stages through which music came to have the art germ, from which the
great product we know has developed.</p>
<p><b>Some Theories</b>.—We can give in this lesson only a few of the
theories offered by those who have discussed the matter of the origin
of music: The Dance, Poetry and Music form a group which cannot
readily be separated; they are not independent of each other, but most
intimately connected. This view fails to take account of the fact that
Music which is, externally, so closely connected with the Dance and
with Poetry, is, in its essence, absolutely distinct. Schopenhauer,
the philosopher from whom Richard Wagner drew inspiration, holds this
view very strongly. He says: “Music is quite independent of the visible
world, is absolutely ignorant of it, and could exist in a certain way
if there were no world; which cannot be said of the other arts.” The
other arts are essentially imitative and representative; they are
based upon Nature. Some writers, the Frenchman Dubos and the English
philosopher Herbert Spencer among them, claim that Music does represent
Nature. They say that as the painter imitates the forms and colors he
sees in nature, so the musician follows the various modulations of the
voice, finding there the basic conceptions of Rhythm, Melody and Color.
Singing, which Spencer considers the original music, is the emphasizing
and intensifying of the properties of speech. Gurney says, <i>per contra</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that “Music creates audible forms, successions and combinations of
tones which have no prototype in Nature and do not exist outside of
Music.” Those who believe that Music is a separate entity therefore
seek to trace it to a completely independent beginning.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a>
Darwin offered another theory as to the way in which man arrived
at Music. His idea is that the faculty of producing musical tones
and rhythm was first acquired by our animal ancestors as a means of
attracting the opposite sex, the faculty being developed and improved
by the process of selection.</p>
<p><b>The Conception of Fixed Scales</b>.—The question is sometimes
raised: How did man reach the conception of fixed scales? Here again
opinions differ. Some consider that the extreme notes were fixed by
the average compass of the human voice in impassioned speech, the
interval being variously divided. Others claim that along with the
vocal phase of music there was an instrumental side, and that the
mechanical conditions in connection with instruments had bearing in the
matter of organizing sounds into a scale; the rude, primitive trumpet
of wood or bark, still found among forest tribes in South America and
Africa, gives a series of harmonic notes. Whistles or flutes made
in prehistoric times with a series of several tones, examples of
combinations of little pipes, such as those known by the name of “Pan’s
Pipes,” also bear on this question. Yet the facts are few and we are
compelled to satisfy ourselves with mere conjecture.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Questions and Suggestions</span>.</p>
<p>Why do we consider music a force in civilization?</p>
<p>What do we mean by Expression in music?</p>

<p>Is the scale used by us the scale of all nations?</p>
<p>In preparing for recitation, students should get an outline of each
lesson by the use of the paragraph headings and then work out the
lesson by the use of the questions that follow. If the reference books
suggested are available, additional reading should be done. A good
plan is for the teacher to assign one or two paragraphs to a pupil and
have the latter bring in such other information of interest as can be
secured. Some questions may be grouped and pupils directed to prepare
a short essay to be read before the class. In regard to dates, the
suggestion is that pupils take turns, lesson by lesson, in presenting
a plan by which to memorize them. When the period is one that can be
related to some well-known event in general history, as the life of
Charlemagne, the Norman Conquest of England, the Crusades, the Wars of
the Roses, discovery of America, invention of printing, etc., it is
well to do so; or make a well-known musician a contemporary of some
artist, statesman, king, scientist, man of letters, etc. The teacher
should be prepared in this manner for each lesson. Events before the
Christian Era may be related to some event or character in Biblical history.

<h2>LESSON I.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music of the Chinese, Japanese and Hindoos</span>.</span></h2>
<p><b>Sources of Our Knowledge</b>.—When we study the music of the
early period of the human race, we find no records such as we are
storing today in our libraries. We must depend upon the discoveries
of archæologists in the buried cities of early civilizations. Of
contemporaneous books, properly speaking, tablets of music explaining
the construction and methods of playing the musical instruments then
in use we have few; if they exist they are in dead languages to
which scholars are but slowly finding the key. It is true that some
instruments have been found, but we can have no certainty that they
are in perfect condition. The principal sources of the information
we possess have been the paintings, decorations and sculptures on
monuments and on the walls of buildings and tombs that have been
unearthed. Early languages were largely pictorial, and records kept in
this manner furnish us representations of the religious, martial, and
social life of the early races.</p>
<p><b>Countries with a Musical Past</b>.—The lands that offer the
greatest field for the study of the music of the past are Chaldea or
Babylonia and Egypt. Some of the old Greek cities, as well as cities
in the western part of Asia Minor and Palestine, have been the subject
of explorations. Still another country abounding in interest to the
student of the music of the past is China, living, yet dead! What a
contrast to Chaldea and Egypt! The civilization of the latter is dead;
China, the older, is still living. These races had a common home, yet
the former, having developed a high civilization and fulfilled its
mission, disappeared from the face of the earth, while China, having
also reached a high state of culture, has remained stagnant, all
energies toward a higher level being arrested.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Common Home of the Race</b>.—Scientists place the cradle of
the human race in the high plateau of Asia, extending from Persia
eastward through Thibet and including part of Manchuria. The yellow
race, according to some ethnologists, is the more akin to the primitive
race; the other two, the white and the black, being derived from it
by emigration, change of climate and mode of living. Van Aalst, the
leading writer on Chinese Music, says that “the first invaders of China
were a band of immigrants fighting their way among the aborigines and
supposed to have come from the country south of the Caspian Sea.” It is
outside the province of this work to detail the arguments that serve
to show the connection of the Chinese with the other races mentioned.
Berosus, the old Babylonian historian, writes: “There was originally
in the land of Babylon a multitude of men of foreign race who had
settled in Chaldea.” These men are known in history by the name of
Akkads or Akkadians, “from the northern mountains,” Sumerians, from the
“southern mountains”; that is, the highland ranges lying to the north
and east of the Euphrates Valley. There were two main types among these
tribes: a yellow, black-haired people, and a red type. The records
show that migrations from this central home came about by reason of
famines, plagues or floods. When did the black-haired, yellow people
swarm off? When did the “red” people, from which Egyptian tradition
claimed ancestry, go away? Probably the Chinese were the first to leave
the central home, taking with them the elements of a considerable
civilization, which also formed the basis of the later Chaldean,
Babylonian, Assyrian and Egyptian cultures, and through various
channels, of the Etrurian and Greek.</p>
<p><b>High Place of Music Among the Chinese</b>.—The science of music
had a high place in Chinese philosophy; the sages alone comprehend the
canons, and the mandarins in music are considered superior to those in
mathematics. Some most interesting dates are given, showing how early
the Chinese had developed a science of music. We are told that in 2277
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
B. C., there were twenty-two writers on the dance and music,
twenty-three on ancient music, twenty-four on playing the <i>Kin</i> and the
<i>Che</i>, and twenty-five on construction of scales. These facts imply
many years of previous development before the time when works treating
of the science of music would be prepared. Confucius, the chief Chinese
philosopher, wrote about ancient music in 551 B. C. Unfortunately,
ancient records and books were almost entirely destroyed, 246 B. C.,
by order of the Emperor then on the throne; he excepted from this
destruction only works on medicine, agriculture and divination. A
comparison of recorded dates shows that the Chinese were writing
learned works on the science of music when the Pharaohs were building
the pyramids.</p>
<p><b>Sonorous Bodies</b>.—The Chinese have always shown a fondness for
instituting likenesses between things in heaven and earth, and things
intellectual and material. According to their theory, there are eight
sound-giving bodies: Stone, Metal, Silk, Bamboo, Wood, Skin, Gourd and
Clay.</p>
<p><b>The Sheng</b>.—One of the most important musical instruments in use
among the Chinese, one that is indispensable to their temple ritual, is
the Sheng. This instrument is the representative of the <b>gourd</b>
principle; originally the bowl was formed from a portion of a gourd
or a calabash, the top being covered by a circular piece of wood with
holes around the margin in which the pipes, seventeen in number, are
fixed; in the side of the gourd is placed a mouthpiece or tube covered
with ivory, through which the player <i>draws</i> his breath. Each pipe is
fitted with a small free reed of copper. A small hole is made in each
pipe just above the bowl, which prevents a pipe from speaking when the
air is drawn in by the player, unless the hole is closed by a finger.
The instrument is placed to the mouth with the pipes slanting toward
the right shoulder. The notes sounded by the pipes of the <i>Sheng</i> as
they are arranged are:</p>

<img alt="" height="395" src="images/image027b.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image027b.jpg">
</div>
<p><b>The Kin</b>.—The principle of the sound of <b>silk</b> is
exemplified in the Kin or Ch’in, the strings, “made of twisted silk,
being stretched over a wooden frame.” This instrument was the favorite
of Confucius, the great law-giver, and in <i>his</i> time was of <i>great
antiquity</i>. The number of strings was five, to agree with the five
elements; the upper part was rounded, to represent the heavens; the
bottom was flat, to represent the ground. The number of strings was
later increased to seven, which is the favored form, tuned to G, A, C,
D, E, G, A, a pentatonic scale.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Se</b>.—Another stringed instrument is the <i>Sê</i>, (also written
<i>Che</i>), which had originally fifty strings. As now used, it has only
twenty-five strings. Four kinds are in use, differing in size and in
number of strings; it is customary that they should give the sound of
two notes simultaneously, generally octaves. Some of these, used by the
most skilful performers, have only thirteen or fourteen strings. The
strings are plucked by two small ivory picks.</p>
<p><b>Flutes</b>.—The sound of <b>bamboo</b> is exemplified in certain
instruments of the flute family. The bamboo plant is used by the
Chinese in very many ways; it is natural that they should use it for
making musical instruments. There are two types of pipes or flutes:
those blown at the end, as a whistle, and those blown across a hole
near one end, as is our modern flute; the Chinese flutes are of the
latter class. They varied in size and in the number of holes, from
three to six, the little finger of each hand not being used. A popular
flute, called the <i>Ti-Tzu</i>, has, in addition to the six finger holes,
one for blowing and one covered with a thin membrane, to vary the
sound. Another kind, very ancient, and much in use, according to
Chinese writers during the period 2205-1122 B. C., may be called,
shortly, the <i>Tche</i>. It has six finger holes, three near each end, and
is pierced with another hole at the middle, across which the player
blows. The scale is said to consist of six semitones, beginning with
F, fifth line treble clef. The peculiar construction of this flute
presents some acoustical problems.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">Tche</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Other sonorous bodies</b> are, <b>metal</b> from which the Chinese
make gongs, bells and trumpets—they seem to have known the principle
of the slide, as in the trombone, but never developed it; <b>stone</b>,
certain varieties, in the shape of the letter L, pierced with a hole at
the angle, suspended in a frame and struck by a hammer; <b>skin</b>,
from which drums were made; <b>clay</b>, from which instruments were
made in shape resembling the ocarina, familiar to us.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Chinese Scales</b>.—The vocal and the instrumental music have
different scales, the former <i>diatonic</i>—with two notes of the seven
omitted, forming a <i>pentatonic</i> (five-tone scale), the letters of
which, since F is a favorite tonic, may be represented by F, G, A, C,
D. The instrumental scales are <i>chromatic</i> in character. When the voice
is accompanied by instruments, the vocal scale is used. Singing is in
unison, modified by fourths, occasionally. The singing tone is a sort
of nasal sing-song, the favorite method a nasal falsetto, the mouth
being nearly closed.</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p>This represents the concluding strophes of the Hymn to Confucius. The
time is very slow; each measure represents a line of four syllables;
between the lines one of the instruments gives a sort of interlude.</p>
<p>So much space has been taken with Chinese music because the
conservatism of that race has preserved instruments and music that date
back to the early history of our race.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Japanese Music</b>.—In the Japanese system we find a <i>pentatonic</i>
scale and a <i>semitonal</i> division of the octave. Japanese music does not
proceed in semitones, the chromatic scale being demanded by the custom
of transposing a melody from one starting point to another, not more
than fourteen sounds for a melody. A favorite Japanese instrument is of
the clarinet type; it is called the <i>Hichi-riki</i>; in length it varies
from a little less than nine inches to a little more. The scale as set
forth by the Institute of Tokio is from G, second line, treble staff to
the A above, F, fifth line, being sharped. This instrument is played
by <i>drawing</i> in the breath. The Japanese have an instrument called the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<i>Sho</i>, similar to the Chinese <i>Sheng</i>. The national instrument is the
<i>Koto</i>, which has thirteen strings, tuned thus: the first, middle C
sharp, the second, F sharp a fifth lower; subsequent strings ascend
in order, G sharp, A, C sharp, D, F sharp, G sharp, A, C sharp, D,
F sharp, G sharp; between the fourth and fifth sounds is a third,
which interval, in practice, was filled by pressing the string behind
the bridge, thus increasing the tension; each string can be raised
a semitone or even a tone by increasing the pressure. By this means
additional notes can be secured, giving a scale identical with the
Greek Dorian or ecclesiastical Aeolian. Much of the popular Japanese
music is written without the extra notes, and the series of tones can
be characterized as a pentatonic scale based on the natural minor. Thus:</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<b>The Hindoos</b>.—Among the Asiatic races that still retain
national, although not a separate political existence, and have a
musical system peculiar to themselves, the Hindoos are prominent. The
Hindoos belong to the Aryan race, (from which we also sprang), and had
their home originally in Central Asia, probably north of the Hindoo
Koosh range. When they swarmed off from the old home they made their
way down through the mountains along the river valleys to the great
fertile plains of India, and conquering the aboriginal races, developed
the system of caste, which has had so great an influence on their
religion, literature, science and art. The old Hindoo literature shows
clearly the high regard in which the art of song was held. Celebrated
minstrels were maintained in the royal courts whose duty it was to
chant songs in praise of their patrons. Music, or song, was just as
indispensable in the religious ceremonies. One of the holy books makes
the statement that “Indra rejects the offering made without music.” In
time the singer became a member of the priestly caste.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="364" src="images/image031.jpg" width="481" id="img_images_image031.jpg">
</div>
<p><b>The Vina</b>.—From antiquity to the present time among the
Hindoos pure instrumental music held almost equal place with song or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
accompanied vocal music. The Hindoo instruments belong to the
percussion types, trumpets and trombones, nose flute, and especially
to the stringed class. It is noteworthy that the simpler kinds, in
which each string gives but one tone, do not exist, whereas there are
many varieties of those which have fingerboards. The oldest and most
important is the Vina, which consists of a wooden pipe about four feet
long attached to two gourds or resonators. The seven metal strings are
stretched over nineteen bridges or frets, becoming gradually higher,
and touch only the last and highest one. The other eighteen serve to
fix the pitch of the tone desired, as in our guitar or mandolin, the
strings being set in vibration by being plucked with a metal thimble
or ring like that used by zither players. Another Hindoo instrument,
considered by some as the prototype of stringed instruments played with
a bow, is the Ravanastron.</p>
<p><b>Hindoo Musical Philosophy</b>.—Hindoo myths ascribe a divine origin
to music. A close connection was established between the scale and
their religious ideas. Each single tone was under the protection of a
nymph, and the first syllables of the names of these nymphs, according
to Clement, the French historian, were given to the tones, thus: Sa,
Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, seven in all, differing in that respect from
the <i>pentatonic</i> form <i>usually</i> found among the early races. In their
endeavor to satisfy the melody of speech, the inflections of the voice
in speaking, the Hindoos divided the interval of the octave into
small parts, and transposed the scale freely up and down; so it is
easily conceivable that their complete system recognized 960 scales,
their sacred writings speaking of 16,000. In practice they contented
themselves with 36, some writers say 72. The following is given as the
scale:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="81" src="images/image032.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image032.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music032.mid" id="id-2742560680618305207">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
The principal feature of Hindoo music is the melody and rhythm, the
latter being very complicated. Of harmony in our sense of the word
there is no sign. In accompanying the voice the Hindoos used only the
pure fifth, which they considered a perfect consonance, the fourth, an
imperfect consonance, and the octave.</p>
<p><b>High Esteem of Music Among the Hindoos</b>.—Music had a high place
among the Hindoos, all festivities made use of it, and the private and
social life demanded it. It was used freely in the Hindoo drama, the
latter calling for the dance, spoken and sung dialogue and instrumental
music and songs. The main reason why Hindoo music did not develop in
the past centuries doubtless lies in the fact that, as in Egypt, the
ruling power was vested in the priesthood, which controlled all the
arts and sciences. Music was so interwoven with their religious rites
and observances, and so hedged around with irrevocable and sacred
laws that the slightest alteration was considered a sacrilege. In
closing this section it may be added that investigators refer the
gipsies, particularly those of Hungary, who are noted for their musical
temperament, to Hindoo origin, probably the pariah caste. Their music,
with its wild, free rhythm and elaborate melodic embellishment, has a
marked resemblance to the music of the Hindoos.</p>

<h2>LESSON II.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music of the Babylonians, Egyptians and Hebrews</span>.</span></h2>
<p><b>History a Record of Change</b>.—History is a record of changing
conditions. Nations rise into prominence and fall again; cities are
built to be torn down by conquerors; even the face of the earth has
changed since the days when the scions of the Aryan race began to leave
their home in Central Asia. Arms of the sea have shrunk to rivers,
rivers to shallow streams, the desert sands have encroached on the once
fertile valleys, and choked the springs and brooks of the meadows.
Geologists tell us that the great valleys were made by the alluvial
deposit washed down from the hills and mountains by the streams. The
Chinese followed the course of the great rivers that made toward the
eastern seas, the Hindoos toward the southern ocean, and still another
“swarm” followed the great rivers Euphrates and Tigris, which came
from the mountains of Western Asia. The great valley lying between the
desert and the mountains, a scene of waste and ruin as far back as the
time of ancient Greece and Rome, was once a most important centre of
population and wealth, the home for centuries of races that had reached
a high degree of culture in the arts and sciences, and the seat of
what may be considered the oldest of extinct civilizations. The valley
was wonderfully fertile, was brought to a high degree of cultivation
and supported an enormous population. As an instance of the physical
changes that have taken place in this region, it may be mentioned that
about 4000 B. C., the Tigris and the Euphrates entered the sea by
different mouths, instead of joining as now and in the days of Abraham,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the patriarch, who came from this region, and the town identified by
modern scholars as “Ur of the Chaldees,” which is now 150 miles up the
Euphrates, was an important seaport.</p>
<p><b>The Chaldeans</b>.—When the Aryans came down into this valley they
found already established there a people whose records are now being
unearthed, called Akkads, belonging to the Mongolian family, who had
reached a high degree of cultivation in art and science. The records
found show that music was an important branch of study; at a very early
date the harp, pipe and cymbals are mentioned, and we infer that the
people were fond of singing, since many sacred hymns have been recorded
in tablets. This race, joined to others, founded the Chaldean kingdom,
the capital being Babylon. In the 12th century B. C., a king of
Assyria, in the northern part of the Tigris valley, conquered Babylon
and thus gained the ascendancy.</p>
<p><b>The Practice of Music Among the Babylonians</b>.—In the great ruins
now being excavated, tablets of clay have been found which give a
vivid idea of the social and religious esteem in which music was held
by the Babylonians. One of these tablets, said to date back more than
three thousand years B. C., contains a representation of musicians. One
strikes with a hammer upon a metal plate, another carries a reed pipe,
a third plays upon a harp of eleven strings, while two others beat
time or give the accent by clapping their hands. Especially rich in
sculpture is the palace of Sennacherib. One of the relief decorations
shows a festival procession in honor of the returning conqueror. In
front walk five men, three with harps, a fourth with a kind of lyre,
whose strings were struck with a plectrum; the fifth bears a double
flute. Two of the harpers and the lyre player dance. Then follow six
women, of whom four carry harps, one blows a double flute, while the
last beats a sort of drum. Following the instrumentalists come six
women and six children singing, who indicate the rhythm by clapping
their hands. From the fact that in these sculptures a few soldiers
indicate an army, we infer that the Babylonians made use of large
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
bodies of players and singers in their great ceremonies. These tablets
indicate that the Babylonians made much use of trumpets to give signals
to the armies and when great masses of the people were gathered
together. That musicians were highly esteemed we judge from the fact
that on one occasion Sennacherib spared the lives of musicians among
his captives, all others being put to death. Since the Chaldeans,
especially, were famous as astronomers and mathematicians, it is
thought that they, like the Egyptian sages, had knowledge of the
mathematical relations of the various intervals.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="408" src="images/image037.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image037.jpg">
</div>
<p><b>Chaldean Instruments</b>.—Two instruments seem to be especially
noticeable: the Symphonia and Sambuca. The former was carried to
Palestine by the Hebrews, at the end of their captivity, and, according
to their accounts, seems to have been a sort of bagpipe, an instrument
particularly suited to a pastoral people like the early Chaldeans. As
to the Sambuca we have no authentic knowledge; it seems, however, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
have been an instrument of the zither type, held horizontally and
played with a plectrum.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a>
A stringed instrument, struck with a hammer, called the Santir is
credited to the Assyrians.</p>
<p><b>Egyptian Music</b>.—When the great Alexandrian Library of
495,000 works of Persian, Chaldean, Hebrew, Egyptian, Greek and
Roman literature was partly destroyed during Julius Cæsar’s battles
with the native Egyptians, in 47 B. C., and finally, A. D. 391, by
Christian fanatics, history suffered an irreparable loss. Treasures of
learning in all branches, the records of early civilizations perished,
never to be replaced. Today we are dependent upon the discoveries of
explorers in the ruins of the great Egyptian cities, temples, tombs
and pyramids. The Egyptians believed that articles of necessity to the
living being were necessary to the individual in a future existence.
If certain things could not, in reality, be placed in the tomb, a
pictorial representation would have almost equal value in the invisible
world. In Egyptian tombs pipes or “flutes” have been found, and in
one instance, in the tomb of a musician, the bronze cymbals he played
when alive. In the various tombs and ruins that have been examined by
explorers, pictorial representations of practically every phase of
Egyptian life have been found. The sources for our knowledge, almost
wholly inferential, are, then, the various pictorial and sculptured
representations of the Egyptian musical instruments and the manner in
which they were used, and a few fragments of their sacred books, which
were forty-two in number, two being devoted to music, although but one
fragment has been found. It must be noted, further, that the Egyptian
Government, although nominally a monarchy, limited, not absolute, was
in reality theocratic. The priestly caste had final power, and the
rules and regulations drawn up by them prescribed the minutest detail
of life, crushing all possibility of independent thought and freedom of
action, a condition fatal to high artistic development.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Place of Music in Egyptian Life</b>.—To show the place of music in
Egyptian life, the following from Ambros’ history will serve admirably:
“From these decorations [on the walls of tombs] we perceive that the
Egyptians made great use of music. We find harps of many sizes and
shapes, small and easily portable, to others beyond the height of
a man, crude and of the utmost simplicity, to others elaborate and
extremely rich in decoration. We note an almost endless variety of
<b>lyres</b>, <b>guitars</b> and <b>mandolins</b> [that is, similar
in type to the instruments we know by these names], single and double
flutes, played by hands of numerous musicians, together with male and
female singers. Music was used to accompany the dance, the funeral
cortège,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a>
the banquet and other social functions. Inscriptions show that there
were musicians of high social position at the court.”</p>
<p><b>Egyptian Instruments</b>.—The records show a development of music
from a crude simplicity in early days to a brilliant and complex system
alongside of the changes in other arts and the sciences, some of the
discoveries going as far back as 1625 B. C. We give illustrations of
several forms of the Egyptian <b>harps</b>. The number of strings
varied from three or four to twenty-one. Mr. J. F. Rowbotham, the
English historian of music, says that “taking B below the bass staff as
the lowest note of the Egyptian scale, (since it likely followed the
Assyrian in this respect) the compass of the great harp would extend
to E, first line, treble staff. The small harps of various sizes had
a compass from D, third line, bass staff, to D or E above the treble
staff. Another series of stringed instruments, known under the general
name, lyres, had the same compass as the small harps; the lutes had a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
low G, (bass) string, and the highest note was C or D on the treble
staff; various forms of the flutes had about the same compass; pipes,
[which may be represented by the flageolet of today] had a compass
of about one octave upward from E, fourth space, treble clef. Other
instruments were of the percussion character, <b>tambourines</b>,
<b>drums</b>, <b>cymbals</b>, etc. Although the Egyptians used
their instruments in combination, there is reason to believe their
practice was the alternation of groups, only occasionally using all
simultaneously, to secure fulness and power of tone.”</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<b>Philosophy and Practice of Egyptian Music</b>.—The consensus
of opinion is that Egyptian music was melodic in character, the
instruments or voices playing or singing in different octaves,
rejecting other intervals. As the Greeks seem to have drawn from the
Egyptians much of their practice in music, it is reasonable to suppose
that they would have used harmony if the Egyptians had been accustomed
to make use of it. As to the Egyptian theory of music we have no
information. Since, however, Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher, was a
student of the Egyptian school for priests, we infer that his teachings
were founded on the science he acquired there; hence it is probable
that the Egyptians were familiar with a seven-fold division of the
octave and the mathematical relations of the fourth and fifth, as well
as other intervals of the scale. Of the old Egyptian hymns we have no
remains unless it be, as some assert, that fragments still exist among
the Coptic Christians.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="321" src="images/image041.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image041.jpg">
</div>
<p><b>The Hebrews</b>.—What a wonderful history is that of the Hebrews!
It has seen nation after nation rise to power and go down. It has been
enslaved, seemingly beyond all possibility of recovering a national
existence, yet regained place. Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Rome, held the
Hebrews, yet the latter are still with us, as a distinct race, while
their conquerors have but pages of history. A glance at the history of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the race will show that they touched the sources of early civilization.
Abraham was a resident, according to the Bible story, of Ur in the
land of the Chaldees, where a considerable civilization had been
attained. From here he went to Canaan, thence to Egypt, and back again
to the country east of the Red Sea. When his descendants went to
Egypt they must have carried with them Syrian music and instruments,
doubtless preserving a trace of Chaldean influence. It was during the
four centuries’ sojourn in Egypt that the Hebrews, though for a time
enslaved, gained the proportions of a nation. As their duties placed
them in close relations to their masters, they gained considerable of
the Egyptian science, literature, customs, etc. At that time, musicians
were slaves, and tradition says that Miriam, the sister of Moses, was a
slave dancing-girl and singer. We know that Moses was instructed in the
learning of the Egyptian priesthood, and in that capacity officiated
in some of the functions of the temple services. Such facts as these
go far to justify the idea that the Hebrews gained their fundamental
notions of music and musical instruments during their long sojourn in
Egypt. Some writers claim that the songs of the Hebrews were adapted to
Egyptian chants. The pastoral life led by the descendants of Abraham,
the period of slavery which the Hebrews suffered in Egypt, and the
subsequent migratory life in the wilderness were not adapted to develop
a people’s song. The life in Palestine for many years was a strenuous
one; and then came another period of slavery among the Assyrians, by
which the Hebrew ideas were again modified.</p>
<p><b>A Religious People</b>.—The Hebrews were an intensely religious
people, the code delivered to them by Moses fixing the status of
music up to the time of the pleasure-loving Solomon. Their music, in
distinction from that of the nations around them, was not sensuous
but a true <i>musica sacra</i>, in this respect more a matter of religion
than of art. During the reign of David, the Levites were organized as
the singers for the Temple services. Music and poetry were the chief
subjects of instruction. David himself composed many of the tunes to
which his Psalms were sung.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Hebrew Poetry and Its Relation to Their Music</b>.—The key to the
music of the Hebrews is their poetry. They grew to numbers under the
most adverse circumstances, and developed a temperament indifferent to
environment and elevated to high spiritual aspiration, making them an
intensely religious people, whose life was little softened by artistic
practice. The effect of the injunction against the making of “graven
images,” as given them in the code of Moses, was to cut them off from
the exercise of the esthetic faculty in sculpture or painting; their
unsettled mode of life prevented outlet in architecture. So they poured
out the whole strength of their passionate, powerful natures in poetry
and song. The most striking characteristic of the Hebrew poetry is the
parallelism of the phrases, each sentence or complete thought being
made up of two similar or contrasted thoughts, and the accompanying
music must have had the same character. The following from the Psalms
shows this feature:</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive</span>
<span class="i9">to the voice of my supplication.”</span>
<span class="i0">“I will not give sleep to my eyes,</span>
<span class="i9">or slumber to mine eyelids.”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p>When the great choirs of men singers were organized for the Temple
services, this parallelism brought about the division into two bodies,
who sang alternately, a practice in use today in certain churches with
ritualistic services, and known as antiphonal singing.</p>
<p><b>Hebrew Music</b>.—It is unfortunate that we have no reason to
believe that the hymns in use in the Jewish synagogues today are sung
to the tunes of thousands of years ago, even if modified. In the
various countries of Europe, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, the airs
are quite different, suggesting that tradition has failed to deliver
anything that can traced to the days of the poet-king of Israel. Some
authorities find in the Gregorian chants traces of Hebrew melodies
which came down from the early Christians of Jewish birth and training.
Clement of Alexandria says that their songs were earnest and dignified;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
there must have been some special character in them as shown by the
command of the Babylonians, “Sing us the songs of Zion.” The principal
relation that the Hebrews have to the history of music arises from the
enduring impress the works of the Psalmist and other portions of the
Scriptures have made upon the music of the Christian Church.</p>
<p><b>Hebrew Instruments</b>.—The Hebrews borrowed their instruments from
other nations, principally from the Egyptians, the one most favored
being a form of the <b>harp</b>, small enough to be portable, used
to give effect to the chanting of the prophets. “To prophesy meant
to sing,” and it is quite likely that Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other
inspired poets uttered their thoughts in verse and song, both being
extemporized.</p>
<p>The student should bear in mind that the various musical instruments
mentioned in the Bible must be understood as types. The harp of David
was not the same as our harp, the organ was not like our great church
instruments, viols, sackbuts, cornets, pipes, psalteries, etc., are
names given by the translators to the Hebrew terms used in the Bible.
They used words with which they were familiar, and which they thought
corresponded in type to the instruments used by the Hebrews.</p>

<h2>LESSON III.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music of the Greeks: Scales</span>.</span></h2>
<p>When we think of Greece, it is Athens, the centre of Greek art and
culture, that comes to mind. An ancient city, Athens, as history
teaches us. The record is that it was founded by Cecrops, who brought
a colony from Egypt, in 1556 B. C., a period when Egypt was a centre
of power, wealth, education and science. Therefore we infer that these
colonists brought with them to Greece the ordinary, popular music and
instruments to which they had become accustomed in their home. But
there was an older Greece; for late discoveries show that there were
five cities, each built upon the ruins of an older city, the first
one going back to 2500 B. C. These earlier inhabitants, themselves an
offshoot of the great Aryan race, were absorbed by the colonists.</p>
<p><b>Music and Myth in Greece</b>.—The beginnings of music in Greece are
mingled with myths: Pan, Apollo, Mercury, Athene and others appear as
the patrons and exemplars of the musical art. Aside from the names of
the mythical gods and goddesses, there are names of human beings that
stand out with clearness. These early musicians were singers or bards
who chanted the songs composed in honor of chiefs and tribal heroes.
Such were Hyagnis, 1506 B. C., Marsyas, his son, and Olympus the elder,
Orpheus, Musæus (1426 B. C.), chief of the Eleusinian mysteries, Linus,
Amphion, Thaletes, whose songs were favorites of Pythagoras; the
greatest of these bards was the blind Homer, to whom the date 900 B. C.
is assigned. “By the Greeks, music as an art was considered an aid in
regulating by rule the inflections of the voice, to mark the places of
emphasis, and to define the pauses in the recitation of their epic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
poetry; and the rhythm of their songs followed strictly laws that had
been laid down; innovation was reprehended, and even
prohibited.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a></p>
<p><b>Early Greek Musicians and Writers</b>.—The earliest musician’s name
met with in the annals of music is that of <b>Terpander</b> (676 B. C),
who is said to have increased the number of strings on the lyre from
four to seven. Next in order was <b>Pythagoras</b> (585-505 B. C.),
who added an eighth string to the lyre. He was called the discoverer
of the Tetrachord, which is still known by this name, the inventor or
discoverer of the Octave Scale, also the discoverer of the ratios of
the consonances; but there is no doubt that he learned all these things
during his sojourn in Egypt. He is also credited with the invention of
the Canon or Monochord with movable bridges, a contrivance still in use
for investigating the ratios of intervals. Unfortunately none of the
writings—if any ever existed—of Pythagoras have come down to us. Our
knowledge of his theories is second-hand, gathered from the writings
of his disciples. Pythagoras seems to have studied sound more in the
manner of the acoustician than of the musician; hence his followers,
or rather those who called themselves by his name, were more concerned
with the ratios of sounds than with their musical effects.</p>
<p>Among the great philosophers who treated on music, <b>Aristotle</b>
(384 B. C.) holds an important place. We find his theories expressed in
one of his works called “Problems.” A pupil of his—<b>Aristoxenus</b>
(350-320 B. C.), has left the most valuable treatise on music, of any
of the ancients, the oldest musical work known at the present time;
it is, unfortunately, not complete. Aristoxenus was a practical, in
addition to being a theoretical musician; he thought that the ear
was the final court of appeal in matters musical. Hence the musical
world was divided into two factions: the Pythagoreans, who held that
music was purely a matter for arithmetical investigation, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Aristoxenians, who claimed that the chief end of music was to be
listened to. This dispute lasted for many centuries. <b>Boethius</b>,
the Roman philosopher, in his writings takes sides with the
Pythagoreans and pours contempt on the mere musician. The successors
of the Pythagoreans are even yet not extinct, as every now and again
some wiseacre turns up with a scheme to secure just intonation, at the
price of losing all that music has gained under our present system.
<b>Plato</b> (430 B. C.), the greatest of philosophers, has much to say
about music; but these sayings are largely incomprehensible to modern
understandings. <b>Euclid</b> (323 B. C.), the great mathematician,
treated largely of music.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a>
<b>Aristides Quintilianus</b> was another
author of great weight. <b>Plutarch</b>, in his <i>Symposia</i>, has one
devoted to music, but unfortunately the meaning of these authors is
often so obscure that it cannot now be discovered. Alexandria, in
Egypt, came into prominence in music when the great library was founded
there by Alexander the Great, in 332 B. C. <b>Eratosthenes</b> (276-196
B. C.), the librarian, figures in the mathematics of music. When we
reach the Christian Era, we meet with two more writers, <b>Didymus</b>
(A. D. 60), who introduced the “minor”<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a>
tone into the scale, and <b>Claudius Ptolemy</b> (A. D. 130).</p>
<p><b>The Music of Ancient Greece the Foundation of Modern European
Music</b>.—Although the history of European music properly begins with
the music of Ancient Greece, we are still very ignorant of the subject,
owing to the fact that there is not in existence a note of music
anterior to the Christian Era. But lately, in the ancient treasure
house at Delphi, a hymn was found inscribed in marble on the inner
wall. Mr. J. P. Mahaffy, an authority in matters pertaining to Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
literature, says: “The time is given by the metre, a long syllable
and three short, variously placed, or two long and a short between
them, in every case 5-8 in a measure.... As regards the accompaniment
or harmonizing of the air, there is none extant. [As to the melody]
although there is rhythm and even a recurrence of phrases to mark the
close of the period, nothing worthy of being called melody in any
modern sense is to be found.” The inscription dates from the third
century before Christ, is a hymn to Apollo and the Muses, and consists
of phrases equal to eighty measures in our modern reckoning. The blank
spaces in the measure were filled in by an instrument, probably the
cithara. Our knowledge is confined to the treatises of mathematicians
and musicians, previously mentioned, and these works are often so
obscure that there is much uncertainty as to their meaning. Besides,
these writings are scattered over a period of about 800 years; that
is, from 585 B. C., the date of Pythagoras, to 130 A. D., the date
of Claudius Ptolemy. Numberless changes took place in the art in
the course of this long period; hence the attempt to elucidate a
homogeneous system by comparing these writings is about as hopeless
as would be the attempt to deduce the modern system of music from the
collocation of the works of Guido and Hucbald of the 10th century with
those of Richter and Prout in the 19th.</p>

</div>
<p>We owe much to the labors of these bygone writers; in fact, the
Greek system of music is the foundation upon which the modern system
is the superstructure. No attempt will be made here to settle the
many disputed points that have puzzled the learned for ten or more
centuries, but a clear and concise account of all that is necessary
to an understanding of the place of this system in the historical
development of music will be given.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Formation of the Greek Scale</b>.—The Greek Scale was founded on a
tetrachord or succession of four sounds, arranged as follows:</p>
<p class="ws8">E (half tone) F (whole tone) G (whole tone) A</p>
<p class="space-below2">It is commonly believed that these letters written on the bass staff,
thus:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="50" src="images/image050.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image050.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music050.mid" id="id-3647222515128571609">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>
<p class="no-indent">represent the exact pitch, as near as may be, of this tetrachord.
In early times the lyre was tuned to these four sounds, and was called
the <i>Tetrachordon</i>; that is, four strings. This gracefully shaped
instrument has remained to this day the symbol of music. This limited
scale was extended by adding another tetrachord, which began with the
last note of the first tetrachord, thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold"><span class="ws8">A—B♭ C D</span><br>E—F G A</p>
<p class="no-indent">making a scale of seven sounds, called the scale of <i>Conjunct</i> or
<i>Joined Tetrachords</i>; also from its seven strings, the Heptachord
scale. The next step was to take in the limit of the octave. The first
way adopted was to raise the highest string a whole tone, thus making
it the octave of the lowest; the sixth string was also raised a whole
tone to make it a whole tone below the seventh. The result was a scale
of seven sounds with one degree omitted, thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold"><span class="ws10">A—B♭ (C) D E</span><br>E—F G A</p>
<p>The next form was:</p>
<p class="f120_bold">E—F G A B (C) D E</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
It will be seen that in this scale the second tetrachord begins a
whole tone above the first, instead of beginning with the final of the
first. It is therefore called the scale of <i>Disjunct</i> or <i>Separated
Tetrachords</i>. The missing sound (C) is here added and the octave scale
is complete. When the lyre had seven strings, the middle string, that
is, the fourth, counting from either end, was called <i>Mese</i>, which
means “middle”; but this word soon gained a secondary meaning which, in
time, became the most important, viz.: <i>Keynote</i>.</p>
<p><b>The Lesser Perfect System</b>.—There was in use at the same time
a scale called the <i>Lesser Perfect System</i>, which was made from the
conjunct seven-note scale by adding another conjunct tetrachord below,
thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold"><span class="ws17">A—B♭ C D</span><br><span class="ws9">E—F G A</span><br>
(A) B—C D E</p>
<p>Then A was added below the first tetrachord to make an octave with the
note <i>Mese</i>. This A was the lowest sound admitted in the Greek System.
It was the Romans who gave to this series of sounds the first seven
letters of the alphabet, which they still retain. This octave (A to A)
is also the origin of our natural minor scale. This Lesser System was
the scale used in the Temple rites. It continued to be used for this
purpose long after the system about to be described was invented.</p>
<p><b>The Greater Perfect System</b>.—This was made from the disjunct
octave by adding a conjunct tetrachord below and one above, thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold"><span class="ws23">E—F G A</span><br><span class="ws13">E—F G A B—C D E</span><br>
(A) B—C D E</p>
<p>The A below was also added, thus making a scale two octaves in extent.
In later times the disjunct tetrachord, <b>B—C—D—E</b>, was added at
the top. This E was the highest note admitted in the Greek System;
consequently, their music never exceeded the limits of two octaves and
a fifth, and the sounds included in these systems were as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="110" src="images/image052.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image052.jpg">

<p class="center"><a href="music/music052_treble.mid" id="id-3052251076561047789">[Listen - Treble Scale]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Peculiar interest attaches to this series of sounds, because in the
Middle Ages they were supposed to be the <i>only</i> sounds admitted by the
Greeks. This accounts for the fact that B was the first note that it
was considered right to use in two forms.</p>
<p><b>The Greek Scales</b>.—The Greeks did not by any means confine
themselves to these sounds, but changed the pitch of the starting
note just as we do with our scales; in other words, both of these
systems might be transposed. Therefore they not only had all the sounds
at command that we have, but as their scales were (theoretically,
at least) tuned acoustically true, they had a great many more. But
their scales were all diatonic (the scales they called Chromatic and
Enharmonic will be explained later), they were all like our natural
minor. When they said “Dorian Scale” they meant just what we mean
when we say scale of D minor; Phrygian Scale meant E minor; Lydian
Scale, F-sharp minor; Mixo-Lydian, G minor. In addition to these
four scales there were three that began a fourth below, one a fourth
below the Dorian, called the Hypo-Dorian, A minor; a fourth below the
Phrygian, called the Hypo-Phrygian, B minor; and a fourth below the
Lydian, called Hypo-Lydian, C-sharp minor; these were the standard
scales of Greek music. These names, Dorian, etc., were retained in the
Ecclesiastical System, but the mistake was made of supposing that the
Greeks used only the fixed sounds given by the untransposed Greater
System. Hence the Church Dorian has B natural, not B-flat; the Church
Phrygian, F natural, not F sharp; and the Church Lydian begins on F
natural, instead of on F sharp. Hence, no two church scales are alike
in the positions of the halftones.

<h2>LESSON IV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music of the Greeks</span> (<i>Concluded</i>)</span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Greek Octave System</b>.—So far, everything is clear
enough; but the next step is not quite so sure. The Greeks
spoke of the Dorian Octave, the Phrygian Octave, and so
on; and the word Octave, used in this way, has been
thought to be synonymous with Scale, which is doubtful,
for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The standard instrument of the Greeks was the octave
lyre. The lowest and highest strings were tuned respectively
A, fifth line bass staff, and A, second space, treble.</p>

<p>These were fixed sounds, but the tuning of the remaining six strings
<i>might be changed</i> at will; therefore, a series of sounds belonging
to any one of these scales could be made; and it will be seen, on
examining the following table, that all the seven scales may be
represented <i>without changing the extreme notes</i>, A to A. Suppose we
make the B flat. Now B-flat is the characteristic note of the Dorian
Scale, in our term, its signature. Therefore this octave would be called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the Dorian Octave, <i>not</i> Dorian Scale. We speak of a scale as beginning
and ending on its <i>keynote</i>; if it does not, we call it a scale passage
in such and such a key.</p>
<p>The notes marked + are the keynotes (<i>Mese</i>). It will be seen at
once that the positions of the halftones differ in <i>each</i> of these
octaves. One cannot help feeling a slight suspicion that some confusion
between scale and octave had a great deal to do with the growth of the
Ecclesiastical Scales.</p>
<p>One of the latest of the ancient writers on music, <b>Claudius
Ptolemy</b> (about 130 A. D.), proposed that all these octaves should
be transposed a <i>fourth lower</i>; this made the Dorian Octave E to E
(all naturals). One result of this change is that many authorities at
the present time call this the Dorian Scale, whereas it is evident
that it is simply the Dorian Octave, as given above, transposed a
<i>fourth lower</i>. Other scales were added from time to time, called
<i>Hyper</i>-Dorian, <i>Hyper</i>-Phrygian, etc., a <i>fourth above</i> the standard
scales; but it is very uncertain whether they were in practical use;
they were probably purely matters of theory.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics Attributed to the Different Greek Scales</b>.—The
Greeks attributed many fanciful characteristics to the various modes
or scales, much as some modern musicians, Berlioz, for example, do
to the different keys. But all seem to have agreed as to the Dorian.
This was considered the true Greek mode, and was called severe,
firm and manly, suitable for martial songs. The Lydian mode was
esteemed to be effeminate, suited to love songs, possibly because
the Lydian Octave corresponds with the scale of A major, and a major
scale was not relished by the Greeks, any more than it was by the
early ecclesiastical musicians. A more probable explanation of this
attribution of different characters to the different scales is, that it
was customary to use certain modes for songs on certain subjects, and
the character of the poetry was transferred to the music.</p>
<p><b>The Greek Chromatic Scale</b> differed altogether from what <i>we</i>
call a chromatic scale. It was made by <i>lowering</i> the pitch of the
<i>fourth</i> and <i>seventh</i> strings above the <i>keynote</i> a halftone.
Supposing the octave lyre to be tuned to the Hypo-Dorian Mode or Scale,
it would begin and end on the Keynote (<i>Mese</i>), thus:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><a href="music/music056a.mid" id="id-6042080487467491138">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Now, by lowering D and G we get the following scale:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="80" src="images/image056b.jpg" width="400" id="img_images_image056b.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music056b.mid" id="id-4152772116964588053">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is the scale that was called Chromatic. It is said to have been at
one time the most popular of all the scales, a statement we can easily
credit, since it contains in itself the two world-wide five-note or
<i>Pentatonic</i> Scales, commonly known as the Scotch or Irish Scales, the
most widely distributed of all scales in Europe, Asia and America.</p>

<p><b>The Greek Enharmonic Scale</b>.—The scale called Enharmonic was
made thus: The fourth and seventh strings were lowered a whole tone;
that is, to the pitch of the second and sixth, the second and sixth
were lowered a <i>quartertone</i>, thus:</p>

C-flat is supposed to be halfway between B and C; F-flat halfway
between E and F. Our modern system does not provide for the notation of
quartertones.</p>

<p><b>Greek Instruments</b>.—The standard instrument of the Greeks was
the <b>Lyre</b>. It bore many names, as Lyre, Tetrachordon, Chelys,
Phorminx, Cithara, etc. There may have been slight <i>differences</i> in the
<i>size and the number of the strings</i>, but great uncertainty prevails
on this point. Under the name of <b>Flute</b> (<i>Aulos</i>) they seem to
have included both <i>Flutes</i> proper and instruments of the <i>hautboy</i>
or <i>clarinet</i> family. These instruments bore a bewildering number of
names, the exact meaning of which is lost. Judging from the pictorial
representations that remain, the Greek instruments were inferior both
in variety and extent to those of the Egyptians. They seem to have
made little use of the Harp, of which instrument the Egyptians had
a great variety. The Greeks seem to have used instruments chiefly,
if not solely, to accompany the voice; and they appear never to have
combined large numbers of instruments for any purpose. Even in their
tragedies, which were performed in immense theatres open to the sky,
the Chorus was limited to fifteen men, accompanied by two flutes. When
accompanying the voice with the lyre they may have occasionally struck
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the fourth, fifth or octave of the vocal melody; but, in general, they
played the voice part. Their most highly developed instrument was a
variety of lyre, the strings of which passed over a bridge placed
one-third of the strings’ length from the lower end of the lyre, thus
causing the lower part of the string to sound the octave of the upper
part. The shorter part of the string was played with a plectrum in
the right hand, the longer part by the fingers of the left hand. This
instrument was called <b>Magadis</b>—from <i>Magas</i>, a bridge. The
term <i>Magadize</i> was eventually used to signify playing or singing in
octaves, and was <i>synonymous</i> with <i>Antiphony</i>.</p>

<p><b>Greek Musical Notation</b>.—Our knowledge of Greek musical notation
is very defective, being derived from only four or five specimens of
ancient music, and a few small fragments. They appear to have used a
<i>separate notation for each mode</i>, and these four hymns are apparently
all in the same mode, but authorities differ as to the mode. They
used the letters of their alphabet, both capital and small, written
in various positions, sometimes upright, sometimes lying on one side.
The notation for the lyre differed from that used for the voice. The
letters representing the <i>vocal</i> part were written <i>above the words</i>,
those representing the <i>instrumental</i> part, <i>below</i> the <i>words</i>. These
<i>letters represented</i> the <i>pitch</i> of the sounds, but <i>not</i> their
<i>duration</i>. The duration was regulated by the <i>meter</i> of the poetry.
Instead of a portion of one of these hymns, the first three lines of
our National Hymn are given as a sample of this notation:</p>
<p class="ws6"><b>R R  Φ  Γ  R  Φ  σ  σ P σ Φ R  Φ R Γ R</b></p>
<p class="ws5">My country ’tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,  Of thee I sing.</p>
<p>These letters have been interpreted as indicating the following sounds,
the transposed Hypo-Lydian Scale in its old form; that is, the Lesser
Perfect System with G sharp as its keynote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<b>Greek View of Harmony</b>.—The question has been much debated
as to whether or not the Greeks practiced harmony. It seems hardly
possible with such a defective notation; but the best argument against
it is, that there is not a word in any of the extant treatises as
to combinations and successions of these combinations, and it is
impossible that any art of harmony should have existed unless some
rules for its employment should have been evolved.</p>
<p><b>Greek Terms in Music</b>.—The modern terminology of music is
largely indebted to the Greek system, although many of the words have
entirely changed their significance. The word Music itself, to the
Greek, meant the whole circle of the sciences, especially Astronomy and
Mathematics. Melody meant the rising and falling of the voice in either
speaking or singing. Harmonia meant rather what we call Melody than
our Harmony. This latter, namely, the sounding together of different
sounds, was called Symphony. Antiphony originally meant singing in
octaves, that is, men with women or boys. Chromatic and Enharmonic
have already been explained. Diapason, now applied chiefly to organ
stops, originally meant the octave; that is, “through all.” Diatonic
has nearly retained its original meaning. Tone, Semitone and Tetrachord
have retained their meaning, with the exception that in the modern
tetrachord the halftone is at the other end.</p>

Lang Syne” is a pentatonic melody, scale of F, with fourth and seventh
omitted. Any series of five notes on the black keys of the piano will
make a pentatonic scale, major character. The language of music was
determined by scholars, hence the use of so many terms with Greek and Latin roots.

<h2>LESSON V.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical System</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Rome the New Centre</b>.—The Power that rules in the affairs of
men seems to have made provision for the elevation of the whole race
by diffusing at intervals of centuries, the treasures of art, science
and thought accumulated by a nation of unusual power and energy. Egypt
dominated the northern part of Africa, the shores of the Mediterranean
and the western slopes of Asia Minor, and in course of time yielded
to the advance of the Greeks, but leaving behind, as a legacy, much
that has had enduring value. What had once been centred in one nation,
under the control of one caste, the priests, was spread through much
of the known world. Greece, in turn, shaped the destinies of expanding
civilization. In the Greek social life free art played a great part;
wherever the Greeks went as merchants and colonists, they carried with
them the principles of Greek art, including music. Greek musicians were
accounted stars of the first magnitude in Egypt, in the Greek colonies
of Italy, and later in Rome, which, after the fall of Greece as a
political factor, became the political, social and artistic centre of
the world; through her conquests and subsequent colonizing diffusing
throughout a larger world than Egypt and Greece knew, an increased
wealth of thought and action which greatly influenced later generations.</p>
<p><b>Rome Dependent Upon Greece</b>.—The Romans did not show a native
instinct for art. Their national qualities were essentially warlike,
and were developed by years of struggle for existence. A people whose
organized life was political and martial, and for so long found
expression first in defence, later in conquest, would not develop a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
true art life. As they grew stronger they built up their collections by
pillage and by purchase; they were taught music, oratory, architecture,
sculpture by Greeks who sought the capital of the world. Roman nobles
imitated Greek customs, learned the Greek language and literature,
cultivated music according to Greek methods, used Greek instruments,
such as the cithara, lyre and flute, sang Greek songs and formed
companies of singers and players to furnish entertainment at their
feasts and at the public spectacles. The Roman drama was modified
by Greek principles, and Greek actors replaced Roman artists; the
pantomime was borrowed from Egypt. Music was a favorite distraction in
the high ranks of Roman society, and men known to history were skilful
players or singers—Sylla, Flaccus, Calpurnius Piso, Titus, Caligula,
Hadrian, and, best known of all, Nero.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Growth of Christianity</b>.—While the Roman Empire, in its turn,
had served the purpose of the Ruling Power in the affairs of men, in
secret a new force was gaining strength, one that was soon to drive
pagan arts and pleasures from open cultivation. In the Catacombs,
in remote sections of the great city, pursued, hunted like beasts,
martyrized, the Christians clung to their faith with its simple rites
of worship, in which the singing of songs was a marked feature.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Whence these songs came is by no means certain, the prevailing opinion
being that they were of Greek origin, modified by Hebrew influence.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a>
In the course of years songs were introduced in the Christian service
with no other warrant than that of tradition. During the years of
persecution no systematic cultivation of music was possible. Later,
when Constantine accepted the Cross, 325 A. D., and Christianity had
triumphed over Paganism, the abuses became such that the ecclesiastical
authorities set themselves to the task of reform and of establishing a
system of song for the use of the Church.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Origin of the Church Scales</b>.—It is absolutely unknown when or
by whom the system of scales, known as the Church Scales, was invented.
The latest writer on the Greek System was <b>Claudius Ptolemy</b>
(about 130 A. D.). In 330, <b>Pope Sylvester</b> established a school
for training church singers, but we have no information as to the
system he employed. The name of <b>Ambrose</b>, Bishop of Milan
(333-397), has for centuries been associated with what are called the
<i>Authentic</i> Scales, but there is no valid evidence whatever that he had
anything to do with their adoption. The name of <b>Pope Gregory</b>
(540-604) has also been associated with another set of scales called
<i>Plagal</i>, with as little authority as in the previous case. There
does not appear to have existed any system of notation in the time
of Ambrose or Gregory. The Greek notation by letters was forgotten,
and the very insufficient system of notation by Neumes had not been
invented. The only writer of any authority after Ptolemy was Boethius,
and he did more to confuse the subject of music than to explain it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Foundation of the Church Scales</b>.—But if we know nothing of the
inventor of the Church Scales, or of the way in which they grew into
their final form, we are, nevertheless, perfectly well informed of
the fully-developed system which, it must be remarked, grew out of a
misunderstanding of the Greek Scales. The Church Scales were founded
on the Greater Perfect System of the Greeks, with this restriction,
namely, that it was <i>not transposable</i>; whereas, we have seen that the
various Greek modes were transpositions of either the Lesser or Greater
Systems.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="70" src="images/image064.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image064.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music064.mid" id="id-7875935459344822286">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is the series of sounds from which the Church Scales were made.
None of them might be <i>altered</i> by sharp or flat, <i>except</i> the <i>B</i> in
the second octave (and this was a later addition which was probably
owing to a remembrance of the Lesser Perfect System in which the B was
flat.) The Greek names were retained for the Church Scales, but as not
one of the notes was inflected, it follows that the <i>halftones</i> occur
in <i>different</i> places in every scale. The scales to which these names
were given were called Authentic, those with the prefix <i>Hypo</i> were
called Plagal. In the table on the next page, the Greek and Church
Scales, also the Greek <i>octaves</i> are given side by side.</p>
<p><b>Confusion Between the Systems</b>.—We may gather from this table
how the confusion between Dorian and Phrygian has arisen. The Phrygian
Octave is identical with the Church Dorian, and the Dorian Octave with
the Church Phrygian. A proof that the Church Scales originated in
the way indicated may be found in the fact that the Church and Greek
Hypo-Dorian Scales are identical, this being the only Greek Scale
without a sharp or flat. The Church Hypo-Lydian was also called the
Ionian Scale; its arrangement of tones and semitones is the <i>same</i> as
that of the <i>modern major scale</i>. It was not considered appropriate for
church music, being looked upon as soft, effeminate and lascivious, by
both Greeks and mediæval churchmen.

A melody in an Authentic Scale had to end on its Keynote, but a melody
in a Plagal Scale ended on the Keynote of its <i>related</i> Authentic
Scale. Observe that the Dorian and Hypo-Mixo-Lydian Scales are
identical; but while the former had to end on the Keynote, D, the
latter ended on G, which is the fourth of its scale, and Keynote of its
<i>related</i> Authentic Scale.</p>
<p>Traces of these Authentic and Plagal Scales may be found in many old
folk-songs. Thus, the melody of the “Last Rose of Summer” begins on the
Keynote, rises in the course of the melody to the octave, but ends by
falling to the Keynote; it is therefore Authentic. On the other hand,
the melody of “Robin Adair” begins on the fourth <i>below</i> the Keynote,
rises to its octave, but ends on the fourth <i>above</i> its initial note
and is Plagal; thus:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="71" src="images/image066.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image066.jpg">
<p class="center"><b>LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.    ROBIN ADAIR</b>.</p>
</div>
<p>The term <i>Hyper</i> (above) was sometimes applied to the Authentic Scales.
In the Greek System the <i>Hyper</i> Scales were the same distance <i>above</i>
the standard scales that the <i>Hypo</i> Scales were <i>below</i>. Although
twelve modes were theoretically admitted in church music, it was for
the most part confined to the eight modes given above.</p>
<p><b>The Dominant</b>.—In addition to the keynote there was another note
in every scale of almost equal importance, called the <i>Dominant</i>. This
name has been retained in the modern system, but with a total <i>change</i>
of meaning. In the Church Scales it meant the <i>Reciting Note</i>, that
is, the note on which the principal part of the words was chanted. In
all the <i>Authentic</i> Scales but the Phrygian, the <i>fifth</i> of the scale
is the <i>Dominant</i>; in the <i>Phrygian</i> the <i>sixth</i> is the <i>Dominant</i>,
because the B was a changeable note, that is, might be natural or
flat. The <i>Dominants</i> of the <i>Plagal</i> Scales are a <i>third below</i> the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Dominants of the related Authentic Scales, except in the
Hypo-Mixo-Lydian, in which the Dominant is a second below that of its
related Authentic Scale. Therefore the <i>Dominant</i> is the <i>sixth</i> of all
the <i>Hypo</i> Scales, but the <i>Hypo-Phrygian</i> and <i>Hypo-Mixo-Lydian</i>, in
which it is the <i>seventh</i>.</p>
<p><b>Hucbald’s Scale</b>.—Two attempts were made in the 10th century to
construct new scales, first by <b>Hucbald</b>, who founded his series
of sounds on a tetrachord, in which the halftone was between the second
and third, thus: A B C D. His object seems to have been to obtain a
series in which a succession of perfect fourths and fifths might be
secured, for which purpose he made use of the following series of sounds:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="59" src="images/image067a.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image067a.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music067a.mid" id="id-4056269346405265948">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In the first tetrachord B was flat, in the third natural; in
the fourth, F was sharp. As to the use made of this scale,
little or nothing is known.</p>
<p><b>Guido’s Scale</b>.—The other attempt, usually attributed to <i>Guido</i>,
a contemporary of Hucbald, resulted in the <i>Hexachord</i> Scale (six-note
scale). This scale was formed by adding a whole tone above and below
the Hucbald tetrachord, thus: G, A, B, C, D, E. To complete the series
of Hexachord Scales, another sound was added, namely: the G below
the A on which the Greek scales and their derivatives, the Church
scales, began. The first seven letters of the Roman alphabet were
used to name the sounds already in use, hence to indicate this sound
the Greek letter, Gamma, was adopted. At the same time the syllables
<i>ut</i>—<i>re</i>—<i>mi</i>—<i>fa</i>—<i>sol</i>—<i>la</i> were used
to name the sounds of every hexachord (precisely as the movable Do is
used now); hence this lowest sound was called <i>Gamma-ut</i>, corrupted
into Gamut. The sounds in the series were indicated by placing after
the letter the syllables that indicated its position in all the
hexachords in which it was found, thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold">G A B—C D E<br><span class="ws7">C D E—F G A</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
1. <i>Gamma—ut</i>. 2. <i>A—re</i>. 3. <i>B—mi</i>. 4. <i>C—Fa—ut</i>, because C is
<i>fa</i> in the first, and <i>ut</i> in the second hexachord. Consequently, to a
mediæval musician, <i>C—fa—ut</i> meant what we would call C, second space
bass clef.</p>
<p>The following table gives all the Hexachord Scales with the names of
the sounds. It is of interest because this system of nomenclature
persisted long after the one which gave rise to it was obsolete.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="470" src="images/image068.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image068.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Hexachords in which the B was flat were called Soft (<i>Mollis</i>);
those in which B was natural, Hard (<i>Dura</i>); the term <i>mollis</i> has been
retained in the French word <i>Bemol</i>, a flat, and in the German name for
a minor key, <i>Moll</i>. The word <i>dura</i> (hard) is also retained in the
German as a name for the major key <i>Dur</i>. When the letters were used as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a means of notation, the sound B-flat was indicated by the old form of
the letter b, which has been retained as the sign for a flat. This was
called B <i>rotundum</i> (round B); when B natural was wanted, a stroke was
put on the right side of the ♭, called B <i>quadratum</i> (squared B), the
sign to this day for a natural.</p>

<h2>LESSON VI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Notation</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>System of Notation by Letters</b>.—The earliest system of
Notation, attributed to <b>Boethius</b>, the Roman philosopher,
seems to have been the placing of letters over the syllables, thus:</p>
<p class="f120_bold">C  C  D    B  C  D</p>
<p class="center space-below3">My country ’tis  of  thee.</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="center"><a href="music/music070a.mid" id="id-7473178374293027052">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>During the period of history dominated by Pope Gregory the Great, a
change was made in this system by which capital letters, small letters
and double letters were used, an improvement, since only the first
seven letters of the alphabet were employed, thus:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="73" src="images/image070b.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image070b.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music070b.mid" id="id-5400361613744579397">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This system seems to have been used chiefly for theoretic
demonstration. These two methods indicated the <i>pitch</i> sufficiently,
but <i>not</i> the <i>duration</i> of the sounds.</p>
<p><b>Neumes</b>.—The next attempt was somewhat of a retrogression instead
of an improvement. Signs called <i>Neumes</i> were placed over the words.
These signs consisted of points, lines, accents, hooks, curves, angles
and a number of other characters placed more or less exactly over the
syllables to which they were intended to be sung, in such manner as to
show, relatively, by the distance above the text, how much the voice
was to rise or fall. They did <i>not</i> indicate <i>duration</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> <i>absolute pitch</i> or
The number of characters in use, according to manuscripts still
preserved, varied from seven to forty. In later forms they appear in
the notation used for the old Plain Song melodies (Gregorian) which
were recalled into general use by Pope Pius X, in 1904.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="712" src="images/image071a.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image071a.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music071a.mid" id="id-2153613789729383273">[Listen: Notation moderne.]</a></p>
</div>
<p><b>Parallel Lines</b>.—Another plan was to use a variable number of
<i>lines</i>, writing the syllables in the spaces, thus:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="63" src="images/image071b.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image071b.jpg">
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
This clumsy contrivance indicated <i>relative</i> pitch well enough, but
<i>not</i> the <i>key</i>—or the duration. The next step was to use lines—which
varied in number—upon or between which the Neumes, which gradually
changed to square notes, were written. The pitch was indicated by using
a <i>red</i> line for F, and a <i>yellow</i> or <i>green</i> line for C. A further
improvement was, to put the letters F or C and later G on one of the
lines at the beginning; the modern clefs are simply modifications of
these letters.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Characters to Indicate Duration</b>.—The
honor of suggesting characters to indicate <i>duration</i> is usually
attributed to <b>Franco of Cologne</b>, an ecclesiastic who lived in
the latter part of the 12th century; but as in the case of Gregory and
Guido, we must believe that his name simply stands as representative of
a period. A system is rarely the work of one man, rather a development
from the labor of many. Franco’s treatise on the subject marked an
epoch. Up to the end of the 13th century the notes in use were the
Longa, Brevis, and Semibrevis, as well as the Duplex Longa, or Maxima.
The smaller values, the Minima, and the Semiminima first occur about
1300. About the middle of the 15th century white notes were introduced
in place of certain of the black, the latter color being reserved only
for the smaller note values. The signs underwent some change at this
time. Maxima, Longa, Brevis, Semibrevis (our whole note), Minima (half
note), Semiminima (quarter), Fusa (eighth), Semifusa (sixteenth).</p>

<p class="space-above2"><b>The Beginnings of Harmony</b>.—Our information as to the beginning
of Harmony is very vague and uncertain. As early as the Saxon times
in England some rude kind of part singing, without written rules
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
apparently, seems to have existed. The first intimations we have of
any scientific attempts are <i>Faburden</i> or <i>Falsoborden</i> and Diaphony
or Organum. Faburden consisted of singing a melody while another voice
sang a <i>drone</i> accompaniment below it; thus:</p>

</div>
<p>Diaphony or Organum consisted of a succession of <i>fourths</i> or <i>fifths</i>
and <i>octaves</i>, thus:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<p class="center space-above2"><b>Two Parts      Three Parts</b></p>

</div>
<p>It has been denied by some authorities that such a barbarous manner
of singing ever existed; but two considerations have been lost sight
of, in making this denial: First, the fourth, fifth and octave were
esteemed the <i>only consonances</i>. Secondly, the undisputed fact that as
late as the time of Chaucer, if not later, what was called “discanting
quatible” or “quinable” existed; this discanting was done as follows:
The performer while singing a melody accompanied himself on the lute,
playing the <i>same melody a fourth or fifth above</i>. It can hardly be
doubted that a style of performance that was esteemed in the 15th, was
perfectly satisfactory to the ears of the 10th century.</p>
<p><b>Discant</b>.—Another early attempt at harmonic effect was the
singing of an <i>extemporaneous</i> part or parts with the melody, called
Discanting. In course of time the Discant or Organum gradually
crystallized into rules, and other intervals were accepted. Strangely
enough, dissonances seem to have been admitted with great freedom, and
thirds and especially sixths, were avoided. The only dissonance that
was <i>not</i> allowed was the <i>minor second</i>.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>The New Organum</b>.—In the 11th century, a method of combining
sounds, called the New Organum, was developed. This kind of Organum
admitted thirds and sixths. The following example will sufficiently
illustrate this:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="70" src="images/image073c.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image073c.jpg">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<b>Measured Music</b>.—The next step in advance, and one that proved
very important and far-reaching in its results on the development of
music, was the invention of a notation that indicated, although not
very conveniently, the <i>relative duration</i> of sounds. Thus it became
possible to express two or more parts in a permanent form. The plan of
this first attempt at a notation by means of which relative duration of
notes might be expressed was very complicated. Music written with these
signs was called Measured Music (<i>Cantus Mensurabilis</i>).</p>
<p><b>The Record of Early Harmony</b>.—There are references to the
manner of using voices in combination in the writings of several
men associated with the Christian Church in its early days.
<b>Censorinus</b>, who lived in the 3d century, makes mention of a
practice of using a melody in octaves accompanied by the fifth to
the lower note of the octave, which is also the fourth to the upper.
<b>Cassiodorus</b>, in the 6th century, mentions various ways of
accompanying the chant with consecutive fourths and fifths. In a
work called “Sentences About Music,” written by <b>Bishop Isidore of
Seville</b>, who lived in the 7th century, we read that “harmony is
a modulation of the voice, the concordance of many sounds and their
agreement.” In the 9th century we meet with the names of several
writers: <b>Remi d’Auxerre</b> who defines harmony as “a consonance of
voices, and their union in one group”; <b>Jean Scot Erigene</b> who
recognized that the succession of chords composed of octaves, fifths
and fourths is a rational one; <b>Odo</b> or <b>Otger</b>, a churchman
of the south of France, whose work was the first to mark an epoch in
the development of the art of music. Also another monk, the Fleming
<b>Hucbald</b>, who lived in the 10th century. They defined consonance
and dissonance, and appear to have been the first to give rules for the
construction of Diaphony. Hucbald says in his “<i>Musica Enchiriadis</i>”:
“Certain dissimilar sounds sung together make an agreeable effect, and
this mingling of voices is sweet to the ear.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>Their immediate successor, <b>Guido</b>, has been credited, unjustly,
with being the inventor of nearly every improvement in the art up to
his time. The old organum closed with his. The earliest writer who
treats of the new organum is <b>John Cotton</b>, in the 11th century.
He was the first to promulgate the rule that contrary motion is always
to be preferred to similar or oblique. He says: “At least two singers
are required in diaphony formed from different sounds. While one
voice sings a melody, the other surrounds it with different tones,
and at the end of the phrases the two voices unite at the unison or
octave.” The fullest development of the new organum was attained
in the works of <b>Guy de Chalis</b>, about the close of the 12th
century. He gives examples in which we find intervals of the eleventh
and twelfth, a demonstration of the existence of a system differing
from the Gregorian, which does not exceed the octave. In the same
epoch, <b>Denis Lewts</b>, of Liége, a Carthusian monk, gives rules
to fix the use of accidental signs, a flat to lower B, a sharp to
raise F. He speaks of these as if they had been in use for a long
time, and indicated that the idea was to avoid the occurrence of the
diminished fifth or the <i>augmented fourth</i>, known in harmony as the
<i>tritone</i>. This process is called <i>Musica Ficta</i>, and formed a part
of the instruction of singers. The examples cited by Lewts conform to
this theory, and show that although in the songs, motets and other
compositions of the period the sharps and flats are not found, it is
because musicians knew the principles and made the application for
themselves. Instruction in those days was chiefly oral, a method which
placed a premium on a retentive memory. By the time that the 13th
century was reached, musical forms and melodies were widely spread, and
as we look back to the 9th century it is possible to note the gradual
development. Harmony always existed, in a limited sense; but it did not
take on a scientific development until the Middle Ages. It is to the
musicians of this latter period, from the 13th to the 15th centuries,
that we must give the honor of having taken the germ of a science of
harmony and of having brought it forward to mature development.

<h2>LESSON VII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music Outside the Church</span></span>.</h2>
<p>Up to this, our study of music in the Christian Era has traced the
development of the art as fostered by the Christian Church, and mainly
among the people of Southern Europe, in whom there was a strong
admixture of the Latin blood and spirit. Before going farther on this
line we will look into the record of music among the races of Northern Europe.</p>
<p><b>Music of the Gauls</b>.—Roman writers give us some account of
the character of the music of the Gauls, which differed much from
the Greco-Latin songs. Roman historians make mention of the songs of
the Gallic bards, who were poets and musicians as well, composing
both religious hymns and songs in honor of their heroes. According to
Diodorus of Sicily, the Gauls practiced the musical art long before
the Christian Era, having regular schools for the instruction of the
younger bards. The instrument used in accompanying their songs was a
sort of lyre, judging from representations on some gold medals made in
the time of Julius Cæsar. Charlemagne ordered a collection of the early
Gallic songs to be made, but the work has not survived.</p>
<p><b>The Celtic Bards</b>.—The Breton bards made use of an instrument
the name of which is variously spelled Crouth, Crowd, Chrotta, Crwth,
played with a bow, with an opening in the upper part through which
the performer placed the left hand in order to press the strings, the
number of which varied from three to six. The crouth of the Welsh
bards differed in some respects from those that were made use of by
the Breton bards. With them, however, a form of the harp became the
national instrument. The early history of Celtic music in Wales in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
particular, is mingled with myth. We have only the names of bards,
Fingal, Fergus and Ossian, no authentic music. What is of importance to
us is the secular organization of the bards. One class included poets,
historians and those skilled in the science of heraldry; another class
comprehended musical bards, harp players bearing the title of doctors
of music, players of the six stringed crouth and singers, who must have
been skilled men, since nine years’ study was exacted of them.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<b>Ireland</b>.—The traditionary bard of Ireland is Fergus, whose
songs were of war and heroes. When St. Patrick introduced Christianity
into Ireland in the 5th century, learning and skill in the arts of
poetry and music grew to be cultivated as extensively as in more
favored lands. In the 10th century, the famous musician was the King
O’Brien Boru, whose harp is still shown in the Dublin Museum. This has
twenty-eight strings, and the sounding board, in which there are four
holes, is very large at the base. After Ireland was conquered by the
English its culture declined, owing to continuous wars and internal strife.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Scotland</b>.—The music of the Scotch, like the other
Celtic races just mentioned, is characteristic. Their harp was similar in form to
the Irish; their favorite instrument was the bagpipe. King James I is
credited with having done much to stimulate an interest in music among
his subjects. Having been a captive in England for a period of eighteen
years, he had acquired great skill in music, which was the solace
of his weary hours. According to a contemporary historian, the king
played a great many of the instruments in use in his day: the bagpipe,
psaltery, organ, harp, lute, flute and dulcimer. The music of Scotland
makes great use of the pentatonic scales, and it is likely that the
original form of many of the old Scottish folk-melodies was pentatonic.
A characteristic feature of Scottish music is the so-called “Scotch
snap,” illustrated in the short notes in the familiar air “Comin’ Thro’
the Rye,” and in the following dance tune:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<p class="center"><b>STRATHSPEY</b></p>
<img alt="" height="60" src="images/image079.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image079.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music079.mid" id="id-3758895960386105651">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>An instrument of so marked characteristics as those displayed by the
bagpipe will naturally develop a characteristic style of music. The
pipers gave extraordinary study to the mastery of their instrument and
noted players acquired wonderful skill.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<b>England</b>.—Until the time of the conquest of England by William
of Normandy (1066), music among the Anglo-Saxons was practiced by the
scalds or bards, minstrels (also called gleemen), and the monks in
the monasteries. Poetry and music were much encouraged by some of the
kings and Alfred the Great (849-901) was widely famed for his skill in
playing the harp and as a singer. In the manuscripts belonging to these
early days in England we read of such instruments as the psaltery, the
rota, little harps of eleven strings, viols, called fiddles, citharas,
cornets, trumpets, etc.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="198" src="images/image080.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image080.jpg">
<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">Scandinavian Ludr</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Scandinavia</b>.—The Runic style of writing,—which has numerous
analogies to the neumes,—used by the northern people, presents many
difficulties in the matter of translation, so that we have little
chance to form an opinion as to the early music of the Scandinavian
races. They have their national poems, a presentation of their myths
in the Edda, and the deeds of their great heroes in the Sagas, songs
which inspired both poets and musicians, an office most generally found
united in one person, called a scald, (equivalent to the Saxon bard).
The sagas were sung or chanted by the scalds to the accompaniment of a
small harp. In 1639 and again in 1734, in the duchy of Schleswig, horns
of pure gold were found which had been used in the worship of Odin,
covered with Runic inscriptions, which have not yet been satisfactorily
deciphered. Other instruments belonging to this period that have been
discovered and preserved in museums are bronze horns somewhat curious in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
shape, called lüdr. These instruments have been tested by experienced
horn players and give forth a fine, resonant tone. Up to the present
nothing has been discovered to indicate that the northern races had a
system of musical notation; melodies were undoubtedly transmitted by
oral communication.</p>
<p><b>Finland</b>.—The people of Finland are intensely musical and
have many beautiful folk-songs. Their national epic is called the
“Kalevala,” and gives the history of the hero, Wainœmonien, god
of music, who by the exercise of his art, became the master of the
universe, analogous to the Greek myth of Orpheus. The Finnish bards
used an instrument called Kantèle or Harpu, a sort of psaltery with
five strings forming the first five notes of the minor scale, G fourth
space, bass staff, to D above.</p>
<p><b>Progress in Southern Europe</b>.—As may be gathered from the
hasty survey of music among the nations in the west and north of
Europe, they did not contribute to its growth during the centuries
under consideration. It was in the south of Europe that the forces
were forming, and not in the Church as heretofore, but outside, among
the people. We cannot say who composed the songs of the people, so
different in character from the songs of the Church; they seemed to
spring up spontaneously and were passed from one to another orally.
The <i>music of the Church lacked measure</i> or rhythm, as we may say,
while the <i>music of the people</i>, closely associated with dancing, was
<i>rhythmic</i>. In fact, the scholarly musicians of that period condemned
the music of the people because of its marked rhythmic character. On
account of the crudeness of the early instruments, often the lack of
them and of competent players, the people were accustomed to sing to
their dancing, a custom still followed in certain places. The next step
was an easy one, that of making new verses to familiar airs. Another
factor in spreading music among the people appears in the <i>traveling
minstrels</i>. Without a fixed residence, owing allegiance to no lord, by
law, in many cases, out of the pale of society, these free sons of art,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
who began to come into prominence in the 11th century, roved from place
to place, resting for the night in castle, monastery, inn or wayside
camp. In return for the hospitality freely given, they sang the songs
they learned from each other and in the various lands they visited.
Their accomplishments in the music line were varied. One, Robert le
Mains, said: “I can play the lute, the violin, the pipe, the bagpipe,
the syrinx, the harp, the gigue, the gittern, the symphony, the
psaltery, the organistrum, the regals, the tabor and the rote. I can
sing a song well and make tales and fables.”</p>
<p><b>Trouvères</b>.—Another influence was also at work, one that
was greatly to affect music, raising it from the level of common
entertainment to an art patronized by the highest social circles. The
Crusades left a permanent influence upon the people of Europe and
upon the institution of Chivalry, the knightly singers (trouvères)
vying with each other in verse and song, as well as in arms. Education
took a higher place and schools became more numerous (12th and 13th
centuries), and music was given recognition; this was the case not
only in schools connected with monasteries, but also in the newly
established universities, such as that at Paris. Secular music also
had schools, so to speak, for, during Lent, when all gay songs were
forbidden, the trouvères and minstrels would stop at some convenient
point and teach their songs to all who would learn; hither the great
lords would send the minstrels in their pay to renew their repertoires
and learn the songs that were most favored by the polite world. It was
not possible that much advance could be made in musical education, from
a scientific side, for there was <i>no</i> general <i>system</i> of <i>convenient
notation</i>. Airs were taught by playing them over, the singer with the
ready ear having the advantage. Still the efforts and studies made in
the monasteries and schools were not fruitless, although the systems
evolved were very complicated, making the reading of music a difficult matter.</p>
<p><b>The Music of the Period</b>.—It is a fortunate thing for the
investigator of the history of music that, at the present time, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
number of collections of the airs of the 12th and 13th centuries are
still in existence; for example, in the National Library, Paris, which
possesses a number of magnificent manuscripts, containing songs noted
down by the French trouvères; also in the Library of the Medical School
of Montpelier there is a collection of nearly four hundred songs,
secular and religious, for two, three or four voices. The <i>melodic
ideas</i> of this period, as indicated by these manuscripts, were <i>vague</i>
and the <i>rhythms uncertain</i>. Yet this music, barbarous as it appears
to us, was not the product of chance, as we may think; it had its
rules, just like the music of today, the art of composing being called
Discant, referred to in Lesson VI. Sometimes these singers of the 12th
and 13th centuries tried to invent original airs, very frequently they
would take several familiar airs, two, three or four and combine them
in what seems to us a crude way, yet in a manner that was pleasing
to the hearers of their time. The style of the songs in use varied
greatly, in spite of the poverty of musical resources. In general, a
song for one voice was used only in setting the <i>Chansons des Gestes</i>,
<i>Romances</i>, <i>Pastourelles</i>, <i>Serventois</i>, <i>Lais</i> and <i>Jeux Partis</i>.
The discant style was used in <i>Motets</i>, <i>Rondeaux</i>, <i>Conduits</i>; according
as these latter compositions were for two, three, four or five voices, they
were called <i>duplum</i>, <i>triplum</i>, <i>quadruplum</i>, and <i>quintuplum</i>.</p>
<p><b>Troubadours</b>.—The cradle of the French troubadours was in
Provence, the south of France. They usually belonged to the nobility,
and, instead of performing their own pieces, had them performed by the
<i>jongleurs</i>, only occasionally consenting to sing for some company
of high-born nobles and ladies. We mention a few of those who were
counted among the troubadours: Richard the Lion-Hearted, of England,
Count William of Poitiers, Rambout, Count of Orange, Pierre d’Auvergne,
Pierre Ramon de Toulouse, Pierre Vidal, Pons de Capdueil, poet, singer
and violinist, Aimeric de Pequilain, Blagobres, a virtuoso on all
instruments, Blondel de Nesle, the Chatelain de Coucy, Thibault, King
of Navarre. Clement, the French historian, gives a list of 28 trouvères
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of the 13th century, less prominent socially than those already
mentioned. The most celebrated of them and the most important from the
historian’s standpoint is <b>Adam de La Hale</b> or <b>Halle</b>, born
1240. He wrote many pieces, of which we have thirty-three songs, some
rondeaux, six motets, some <i>Jeux Partis</i>, among the latter being a work
which is regarded as a sort of comic opera, sometimes called the “first
opera”: “Robin and Marion”; it consists of dialogue and airs.</p>

<p><b>Minnesingers</b>.—While the trouvères and troubadours were singing
in Provence and in France, an analogous association was forming in
Germany, to which the name Minnesingers (<i>Minne</i>, old German, “love”)
was given. A list of names belonging to the 13th century includes
162 men, among whom are several occupying thrones. Names that have
interest for us are Klingsor, Wolfram von Eschenbach (author of a poem
on “Parcival”), Gottfried of Strassburg (author of a poem “Tristan
and Isolde”), <b>Walter von der Vogelweide</b>, the <b>Chevalier
Tannhaeuser</b> and Heinrich Meissen, called Frauenlob. Richard Wagner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
has introduced some of these men in his operas. The versification of
the Minnesingers has been much admired by critics; it was filled with
art as well as beauty. Their love themes differed from those of the
Provençal singers in that while the poetry of the latter declared love
as a gallant sentiment, the Germans gave it a loftier tone by mingling
it with the Madonna sentiment.</p>
<p><b>Folk-Song</b>.—While the German nobles were employing themselves
in the service of art, the people were not idle. They had their tunes
and their verses. The <i>Locheimer Liederbuch</i> (1452), contains a number
of songs, some of which are undoubtedly very old; they are melodious,
varied in rhythm and full of naïve simplicity. Some of them are
arranged in the popular <i>three-voice</i> style, and show correct part
leading, the inclination being <i>toward our major and minor modes</i>
instead of the Church Modes.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Mastersingers</b>.—The most noted musical organization among the
people was that of the Mastersingers (celebrated in Richard Wagner’s
opera); Nuremberg, Mayence, Strassburg and Frankfort were their
centres. The members were organized into a Guild, just as was the case
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in trade affairs; they had a charter from the Emperor Charles IV.
Their poetry and music were not elevated, for the members of the Guild
were not of a standing and an education to give them real skill in
the fine arts. The records of the Mastersingers show that the members
were principally tradesmen, such as farriers, armorers, locksmiths,
tailors, cobblers; yet there were some members who could lay claims
to culture and higher standing, as engravers, physicians and a few
gentlemen of leisure. The most conspicuous of them all was <b>Hans
Sachs</b>, the cobbler-poet of Nuremberg. Their works were marked by
<i>monotonous melody</i>, (for the pitch is but little varied) and a heavy,
clumsy rhythm. To make up for the lack of real artistic idea they were
<i>pedantic</i> to an extreme; composition was hedged about by a multitude
of rules, to which composers must give exact obedience. These rules
were given in a code called Tablatura. They held contests in which the
members vied in producing works exemplifying the principles of the organization.</p>

<h2>LESSON VIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Causes of Polyphonic Development and the<br>
                          Importance of the Polyphonic Era</span></span>.</h2>
<p>In the Introduction attention was called to the fact that the labors of
musicians to develop an art of music varied between the effort to make
artistic use of the material of music, that is, to give it definite
form, and to make it express the feelings of mankind; the first is in
the line of construction, the second, content. The period we now take
up was concerned most deeply, in its earlier stages, as we shall see,
with finding adequate and logical principles of construction by which a
musical composition of more or less length could be made from a simple
musical idea and in which more than one voice could be used.</p>
<p>This period should be studied with the greatest thoroughness, and all
possible examples of music of the composers representative of the
period should be examined that one may gather a clear idea of the
beginnings of composition and the development that shows from one
generation to the next. These first gropings after the principles
are matters of extreme interest to the musician when he compares the
results in the music of the twentieth century.</p>
<p><b>The Polyphonic and Monophonic Styles</b>.—Students frequently
express surprise that the complicated polyphonic or contrapuntal
system, which began to take shape in the 11th century, should appear
first, historically. The pupil in composition begins his studies with
the harmonic or monophonic style and is afterwards inducted into the
polyphonic style. Why did the musical art develop along polyphonic and
not on the simpler lines? It is intended that this lesson and those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
that follow shall show some of the influences that caused the line
of development to move in a polyphonic and not in a monophonic
direction. One thought is important to note. The elements of the
simple, monophonic style <i>were present</i> in the music of the early
centuries, in the <i>people’s song</i>, principally; since, however, it was
the Church that determined the direction of artistic composition, the
simple, natural principles of melody-making <i>yielded precedence to</i> a
more highly organized, <i>intellectual process</i>. Before taking up the
consideration of these matters it is well to get an understanding of
the terms Monophony and Polyphony.</p>
<p>There are two methods of giving harmonic support to a melody: by
adding an accompaniment of chords, in simple or elaborated form, or
by dividing the notes of the chords among three or more voices, which
notes are sung or played simultaneously with the melody (an example
is furnished by any simple air with accompaniment or a hymn-tune in
four parts, in which the “air” or melody is in the soprano); this is
Monophony, (<i>monos</i>—Greek for “one,” <i>phone</i>—“sound”); a second
method is to add to the given melody other melodies, each independent
in its movement up and down and in the duration of its successive
sounds so far as concerns the movement and duration of the sounds in
the given melody. This is Polyphony (<i>polus</i>, Greek for “many”).</p>
<p><b>Relation of Polyphonic to Modern Music</b>.—The exact relation of
the Polyphonic Era to modern music has rarely been correctly estimated.
Writers on this phase of the development of music are apt to lose
themselves in wonder on noting the scientific growth of the art, and
to express their great surprise that so peculiar an evolution should
occur. This view of the question is totally inadequate. In order truly
to estimate the value and influence of the period, it is necessary to
inquire into the properties of the materials of musical construction
which were developed, and the value of those materials as a foundation
for the modern structure of music, apparently so different from the
early forms, but yet so intimately related to these forms.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>Polyphonic music presents to the student so complex a form as to
require the aid of material imagery in order to help the mind to a
proper conception of it. Perhaps no more misleading idea has been
advanced than that which makes use of the Gothic cathedral as an
illustration of polyphonic form. It is true that in its multiplicity
and yet inter-relation of details the cathedral expresses one of the
dominant ideas of polyphonic music; but here the likeness fails. A
nicer perception of the subject may be gained by comparing <i>polyphonic
music</i> to the <i>foundation of a Gothic cathedral</i>, strong and massive
in construction, of utmost need to the permanence of the building,
but entirely lost sight of in a general view of the whole structure;
the importance of the comparison being the likeness of the complex
and highly-developed superstructure to monophonic or modern music,
seemingly so independent of what lies beneath, but in reality,
dependent upon, and intimately connected with the established basis.
Only in this way can we apprehend the real value of the polyphonic
foundation to our superstructure of modern music; but for that
foundation our modern music must have remained in its infancy for
centuries to come. No freedom of artistic expression can be gained
until absolute command of the material to be used has been obtained,
and the principles thoroughly assimilated by the artist.</p>
<p><b>Polyphony and Monophony Contrasted</b>.—In the concrete,
<i>polyphonic</i> music may be represented by a series of lines representing
<i>separate</i> and distinct <i>melodies</i>; though a principal melody is
always used, it is not supported by chords of harmonic structure but
by other melodies, or transpositions of the same melody, so used as to
contrast with and support each other. Polyphonic music was essentially
melodic, and, as has been very aptly stated, is to be thought of
horizontally. Monophonic music might best be represented by one
horizontal line supported at intervals by short, perpendicular lines.
In this case the horizontal line represents the only distinct melody,
and the perpendicular lines the subordinate or harmonic support or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
accompaniment. The following example illustrates the process of using
the same melody to furnish the principal idea and also the accompanying
support, the latter being at the same time simply a transposition of
the original melody.</p>

<p><b>Search for Structural Principles</b>.—While this question of the
relation of polyphonic music to modern music may not apply to the first
step in the development of the polyphonic style, yet it furnishes a
preface to a discussion of the earliest stages of polyphonic evolution.
The period preceding the year 1000 A. D. was truly a <i>period</i> of
<i>fundamental research</i> into the underlying principles of melodic and
harmonic structure; but so crude and hesitating was the use of what was
found that it is certain that polyphonic material was entirely misused
until the birth of “measured music” dispelled this darkness by the
enlightening influence of Proportion and Form. So many forms of musical
growth, such as came in later years, were impossible without the
mensural proportion, that is, music written so as to indicate duration,
that this initial period gathered but a chaotic mass of musical
material which was left undigested and unassimilated until the epoch of
the Paris school.</p>
<p><b>Beginning of Polyphony in Greek Magadizing</b>.—The music of the
Middle Ages has great interest for the historian and the student. It
stands between our music and the music of the ancients; it drove its
roots deep into the ancient time and extended its branches far into the
contemporaneous epoch. It is the struggle between the two elements,
the changes foreshadowed and apparent that give such interest to the
history of music in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Polyphonic music was long in growing. To understand clearly, one
must examine it from its very <i>beginning</i> in Greek <i>magadizing</i>,
referred to in Lesson V. Music for many centuries was, in all its most
important phases, entirely vocal. The ancients, probably because of
the crude forms of their instruments, valued the human voice as the
most suitable means of expressing the feelings through music, thus
causing the peculiar phenomenon of the extremely late development of
dissonances. While instruments can easily perform even the harshest of
the dissonances, it is almost impossible for untrained voices to sing
other than the more simple consonances. For this reason, the dependence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
on the voice as practically the only medium for the expression of
musical ideas forced the cultivators of music to use the simple
consonances of the octave, fourth and fifth. In its earliest stages
music was entirely melodic and was limited to the use of one distinct
melody, so that, no matter how many were singing, but <i>one melody</i> was
employed. Soon arose the problem of accommodating the voices of boys
and men to the same melody. It was manifestly impossible to have men
and boys sing in unison, because of the difference in the compass of
their voices; so the Greeks hit upon the plan of causing them to <i>sing
in octaves</i>, a plan which science sanctioned, for had not Pythagoras
proven that the octave, after the unison, was the most perfect
consonance? This the Greeks called Magadizing. Why the Greeks, knowing
as they did the other consonances, did not magadize in the fourth and
fifth cannot be explained; the only argument that can be advanced is,
that their melodies were so limited in range that the voice of any man,
whether tenor or bass, could without difficulty reach the highest or
lowest tones of a melody in unison. While magadizing among the Greeks
cannot be counted as a great advance toward the realm of polyphony and
harmony, yet it was the first important step in the evolution, and as
such, is important. So far, the voices singing <i>simultaneously</i>, though
at a different pitch, and moving together in <i>similar</i> time values,
followed monophonic methods.</p>
<p><b>Organum the Next Step</b>.—Further development did not take
place until the destruction of Greek civilization had occurred and a
sufficient lapse of time had allowed the Christian Church to establish
itself: in a religious sense, in the hearts of the people, and in
a permanent sense, by building churches and monasteries. In these
monasteries we find the next great advance in magadizing, though now
under the name of Diaphony or Organum. The musical learning of the
time was painfully inadequate for the uses to which it was put. There
remained in existence only a few of the Greek scientific scales,
and those woefully distorted in form; no simple notation or musical
literature; and in all probability, only a tradition in regard to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
melodic construction and magadizing. Perhaps this was just as well,
however, for the problem confronting these monks differed greatly from
that solved by the Greeks. In the monasteries <i>only men’s voices were
used</i>, and these without special regard to the compass. The problem
was this: Given a melody to sing, using men’s voices of every range,
from high tenor to low bass, without using independent parts. The
difficulties were two in number: they had no conception of independent
parts, and their melodies were of greater range than those of the
Greeks, thus forbidding the practice of singing entirely in the octave
or unison. The solution was reached in the following way, as indicated
in the preceding lesson: If the octave, unison, fourth and fifth were
consonances, why not <i>sing in the fourth and fifth</i> as well as in the
unison and octave? They had as yet no idea of singing two distinct
melodies at the same time, but thought only of singing the same melody
in the most consonant or agreeable manner. The result was music which
sounded like the following example; while it was crude and harsh, it
gave every monk opportunity to sing simultaneously the same melody, no
matter what the range of his voice:</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="center"><a href="music/music094a.mid" id="id-5259349366833839243">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>About the close of the ninth century, as we learned in Lesson VI,
at the time of <b>Otger</b> or <b>Odo</b>, an abbot of Provence, in
France, organizing had so developed as to be written for as many as
four parts, using, however, only the perfect consonances, as the next
example will show. In reality there are but two parts, as the two lower
voices double the upper.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<b>Secular Organum</b>.—The most remarkable advance is shown in a
form called Secular Organum, probably because of some relation to the
Folk-song and the common people. This form showed the use not only
of perfect consonances but of the imperfect consonance of the third;
and, wonderful to relate, of a second, though only in a passing sense.
That such a discord should be used is a remarkable commentary on the
inherent sense of harmony which seemed to exist naturally, even at that
early day. This form may have had its germ in the drone bass supplied
by the bagpipe, which figured in the music of the people.</p>

</div>
<p class="center space-below2">Example of Secular Organum showing use of third and second.</p>
<p><b>The Workers</b>.—Two men, as was shown in the preceding lesson,
were instrumental in remarkably furthering this growth of music.
<b>Hucbald</b>, of St. Amand, in Flanders, was born in 840 A. D. and
died in 930. He was a friend of Otger of Provence, and it is through
the latter that some of Hucbald’s work is preserved. Hucbald probably
never wrote in organum of more than two parts, though mention is made
of an organum credited to him and having in addition to the two voices,
a third singing a pedal-point, or a bass on one single tone. His
principal work is a manuscript on organum, a work of great reference
value. <b>Guido of Arezzo</b>, born 990, died 1050, is of even more
importance. Unlike Hucbald and Otger, he seems to have been more than
a secluded monk, for he visited Rome and was a well-known figure in
the church. He was a most active teacher, and while his chief work was
in developing notation, he nevertheless contributed important material
in the form of organum, writing in as many as four parts, though in
respect to the use of the less perfect consonances he was very little
freer than Hucbald.</p>
<p>A short example, extracted from an 11th century three-part
composition, is given here as a specimen of the combinations and
successions that were tolerated by the ears of the Middle Ages, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
show the tendency toward greater freedom in the direction of the motion
of the parts, pointing toward those principles which later formed the
science of Counterpoint.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="241" src="images/image096.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image096.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music096.mid" id="id-3491505405692519057">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Several interesting points may be seen in this barbarous composition:
First, the imitation by the second tenor of the phrase given by the
first tenor. This is evidently intentional, as this phrase occurs three
times in the course of the composition and is imitated in the same
way every time. This same phrase occurs near the end of the bass part
(which is the theme or <i>Cantus</i>) and it <i>may</i> have been chosen for
this very reason for use in the Discant parts. Secondly, the initial
and final chords, viz.: root, fifth and octave—are familiar to all
students of Strict Counterpoint. Writers as late as Cherubini call this
combination the best for beginning and ending Three Part Counterpoint.</p>
<p><b>Development Determined by the Church</b>.—The Church and its
beliefs were responsible for this singular yet not illogical
development. Considering the peculiar monastic conditions, the
evolution could not be expected to occur along lines which it would
have taken had it been developed among the people and under the
influence of the Folk-song. The learning of these monks was largely
in church lore, and this, with a desire for a peculiar church music,
led to the <i>discarding</i> of the natural and vivacious <i>melodies</i> and
<i>rhythms</i> of the <i>people</i>, for the scientific and ascetic music and
discipline of monastic religion. The one great advantage of this
period to modern music was the constant association with the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
intervals of the scale; an association which may be partially
responsible for our modern Tonic and Dominant harmonies. On the
whole, this period represents the marking out of the lines of musical
development for the eight centuries following, though the men
responsible for this beginning could hardly have known or appreciated
the impetus which was to be given polyphonic music by the invention of
their simple devices to accommodate voices of different compass and to
secure concerted singing.</p>

events coinciding with this period; also historical characters.
Scholarship was cherished principally in the Church and in the
monasteries, hence the predominance of Churchmen in the early history
of music. Hucbald lived during the time of Alfred the Great; Guido
died 16 years before the battle of Hastings (1066). A useful device in
fixing the details of a lesson is for the teacher to arrange that the

<h2>LESSON IX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Paris School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Influence of Art on Music</b>.—All of the fine arts, with the
exception of Music had, by the year 1100, reached a fairly high stage
of development due, no doubt, to the fact that they are to a great
extent composed of concrete materials. Music, owing to its lack of
the concrete and the inability of men literally to place their hands
upon its material, had lagged behind, so that in 1100 we find only a
small amount of material, and that in a most chaotic condition. This
material was, however, sufficient to produce definite musical forms
if united into a homogeneous whole; such a state, however, could
be produced only as the result of some great influence which would
galvanize the component parts into action. Fortunately, there was
just such an influence, one which had passed through an evolution
similar to that needed in music, though because of its more concrete
form and its necessity to man, this evolution had occurred at a
proportionately earlier date. This influence was an art form, a phase
of architecture known as the Gothic. Gothic architecture was a form
built up by the unifying of the principal styles of architecture into
one uniform whole, and composed of a <i>multiplicity</i> of <i>details</i>,
but of such evident <i>relation to each other</i> as to make a distinct art
form. This form was first used in Paris about the year 1000 A. D.
Music was, approximately, in the same condition as Architecture before
the birth of the Gothic principle, and needed a stimulus, a comrade
art undergoing much the same evolution, to start it on its path of
polyphonic development. In the year 1100 musical chaos became united
into one uniform art by means of Measured Music or Proportion, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
allowing the systematizing of the mass of then existing material,
and the construction of definite art forms. Since Architecture had
undergone just such a change one century before, it is more than
probable that the effect of this change was the starting of a similar
one in Music, though the result was not to show until one hundred years
after its occurrence in the kindred art.</p>
<p><b>Paris the Centre of Europe</b>.—It was natural that these two great
changes should take place in Paris, at that time the centre of wealth
and learning for all Europe. Paris, in addition to its many other
advantages, had long possessed a great university which had produced
many scholars and theologians. The influence of the Church in all art
was then paramount, for all art was employed in the service of the
Church; Architecture gave to the Church its Gothic cathedrals; Painting
and Frescoing its marvelous interior decorations; while Music made
possible the richer forms of the service or liturgy. In that sense the
Church, in its centre of theological study, would undoubtedly react on
the practice of music and produce more beautiful forms for the service.
In this period it is worthy of note that all the <i>famous musicians</i>,
as before, were <i>monks</i>, or men employed in the Church, and the reason
for this condition is plain: there was no art of music outside of the Church.</p>
<p><b>Measured Music</b>.—Just as the use of many voices produced singing
in parts, so did it produce Measured Music. To make it possible to
use more than two parts at the same time it was necessary to have
some definite agreement as to the value of the notes, in order to
have certain uniform times for beginning, ending and performing the
different portions of a composition agreeably; and so Measured Music
was born. It may be said here that the different metrical divisions
were not shown by means of bar lines as we now use them, but by
different groupings of the notes, the time value of each depending on
its relative position to the others. Perhaps of all forms produced by
this system, the <i>Organum Purum</i> was the earliest and most peculiar.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
It consisted of a <i>Cantus Firmus</i> set to words, and metrical in form; a
second voice freely extemporized a higher part, evidently the only rule
being that the two finish together. At a late date, strict Discant
sometimes alternated with the old Organum, making it much less free in
character.</p>
<p><b>The Important Forms</b>.—In reality, the important forms produced
were entirely in strict metrical divisions. Of these, the most
important were the so-called strict Organum, the Conductus, the Roundel
and the Motet. Of the strict Organum very little is known, excepting
that it was a strictly metrical form, differing, in that sense only,
from the Organum Purum; it had also words for all parts and not only
for the Cantus Firmus, as had the older forms. The Conductus, from the
Latin <i>conducere</i>, to conduct, was important, and was a secular form
having as its basis a popular melody or a newly invented one, secular
words and much freer intervals than church compositions. Each part
was expected to be melodious; and it varied from two to four in the
number of voices used. It was sung during a march, a funeral cortège or
procession.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Conductus for three voices showing that each
part is a distinct melody. Oxford History of Music, Vol. I.</p>
<p><b>The Roundel</b>, from an historical view-point, was the most
important form, for in it much use was made of Imitation. It can best
be explained in the words of Walter Odington, a theorist of the time:
“Let a melody, with or without a text, in one of the regular modes of
rhythm, and as beautiful as possible, be devised, and let each voice
sing this in turn. And at the same time let other melodies be devised
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to accompany it in the second and (if there be three voices) in the
third voice; let them proceed in consonances, and so that when one
voice ascends another descends, and let the third not follow too
closely the movement of either of the others, except perhaps for the
sake of greater beauty. And let all of these melodies be sung by each
voice in turn.” While the use of Imitation is important in that it
recognizes the <i>repetition</i> of a set phrase as an <i>aid</i> to <i>Unity</i>, its
importance is detracted from, at least at this period, because it was
not used in any of the other forms then in vogue.</p>

There are six distinct melodic phrases, and by numbering these wherever

<p><b>Imitation a Means of Securing Unity</b>.—An art form must submit to
the laws of the human mind, which demand that a work of art shall show
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
three principles: Unity, Variety or Contrast and Proportion or
Symmetry. The problem set before the old composers was to produce
musical works which should exhibit obedience to the canons of art
as determined in the sister arts which had already reached great
perfection. Unity in a musical work means that it is a development of
one central thought, in elaborate works, of several leading ideas. The
germ of a musical composition is in the Theme. The composer’s problem
is to elaborate a piece of some length from this Theme, in that way to
secure Unity of idea. If he were limited to writing in one part, he
would be compelled to <i>repeat</i> the Theme a number of times, either on
the <i>same</i> or on a <i>different</i> degree. When he must write for three
or more voices the problem becomes more complicated. Let us imagine
a composer of the 12th-century at his work. He has a theme to use,
like the one in the example at the end of the preceding paragraph,
which he is to use in three parts. From the composers of the preceding
centuries he received the principle of <i>transposing</i> the theme a fourth
or fifth or octave higher or lower, thus singing the same melody
<i>simultaneously</i> at different pitches; but this he rejects as crude; he
has passed that stage and wishes to use a newer, more advanced method.
Obviously his recourse will be to let each of the other two voices sing
the opening theme <i>successively</i> at the same pitch. To stop with this
change would result only in three successive repetitions of the opening
theme; so he makes the second and third voices sing the phrases used by
the first voice after the first theme has been given, which serve as
an accompaniment to the second and third entries of the first theme;
thus all the voices sing the various phrases, at different times and
in different successions, as shown by the numbering of the phrases.
In later times the principal phrases were sung <i>successively and
transposed</i> at the same time. This principle of Imitation is the very
foundation of the later complicated polyphonic system.</p>
<p><b>The Motet</b>.—In the form of the Motet we note many peculiarities.
Each voice had different words, though the Tenor or foundation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
composition used but <i>one</i> single word throughout; also, the Tenor
was composed of a certain metrical and melodic figure closely adhered
to and built up out of some popular song. The words and the form were
sacred in that they were used in worship.</p>
<p><b>The Men of the Time</b>.—There are many men who wrote in these
forms but it is only necessary to examine those of importance.
<b>Franco of Cologne</b> (1150-1220), (dates disputed), an organist,
was probably the pioneer in the adoption of Measured Music. He first
advocated the use of triple meter and classified the dissonances of
major and minor thirds and sixths. He used his influence <i>against</i>
the use of <i>consecutive fourths</i> and <i>fifths</i>, and <i>for</i> the use of
<i>contrary motion</i>. The result is in many ways shown in the following example:</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="110" src="images/image104.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image104.jpg">
<p class="center"><a href="music/music104.mid" id="id-5563828551322909397">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p><b>Leonin</b> (about 1140) and <b>Perotin</b> (his pupil) were
organists at Notre Dame in Paris. The former was noteworthy in the
reform of notation, while the latter is known principally for his use
of crude Imitation, and a tendency not to use consecutive fourths
and fifths, though he never entirely succeeded in eradicating them.
<b>Franco of Paris</b> (1150———), often confused with his namesake
of Cologne, was a theoretician, improved notation, and wrote a treatise
on Mensural Music. <b>Jean de Garlande</b> (1170-125—) not only wrote
a very valuable treatise on Mensural Music, but was also a composer of
note; his writings contained specimens of Double Counterpoint, though
probably used without the intention of producing them. <b>Jerome de
Moravie</b> (1260) wrote a scholarly treatise on Discant, and such was
his ability that he illustrated it with his own compositions, making it
one of the most valuable reference works in existence. It is worthy of
mention that all of these men were churchmen in the sense that their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
work was all done in, or with the approval of, the Church, and
was therefore influenced by the peculiar beliefs and customs then
obtaining in that institution. This point must ever be kept in mind,
for any prolonged contact with Folk-music must have changed the entire
development of the art; therefore we must regard the Church as the
dominant influence of early music.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>.—The work of this period can hardly be over-estimated.
First we see the influence of the Gothic in architecture, producing
a corresponding unity in music; a unity which was concomitant with
Measured or Mensural Music. We next see the attempt to combine metrical
with unmetrical forms in the Organum Purum, and the final result in
the strict form of Organum. Then we note the freedom shown in the
Conductus, Roundel and Motet, as well as freedom in the use of more
pleasing intervals, with the tendency to eradicate consecutive fourths
and fifths; the use of contrary motion instead of parallel, and the
consequent melodic freedom of the voices, and finally the use of
Imitation, though perhaps unintentionally, except in the Roundel. This
period then marks the acquisition not only of new intervals, new forms,
new styles of melodic writing, imitation, measured music and simple
counterpoint of note against note, but also forms the foundation for a
rapid development by bequeathing to the Gallo-Belgic School a wealth of
material, bound up with rules and only half-suspected as to its value,
it is true, but broad and firm enough to sustain a mighty structure of
true Polyphonic Music.</p>

<h2>LESSON X.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Gallo-Belgic School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>A New Art Centre</b>.—The development of any art, and more
especially Music, requires the dominance of wealth, learning and
general civilizing forces, to form an epoch-marking school. Paris for
a time satisfactorily filled these conditions, and then gave place
to a school, stronger and better equipped: that of the Netherlands.
There were several reasons for this change in the centre of musical
activity. So long as Paris was dominant in wealth and civilization,
and so long as she maintained her supremacy in the intellectual fields
of the Church and university, so long did she retain the centre of
culture; but when her wealth became such as to produce degeneracy
in the taste for pure art, and love of show rather than real worth
became predominant, then her native pupils began to lose their
intellectual strength, and the pupils from foreign countries began
to furnish the real culture. The establishment of the Papal See at
Avignon in the south of France doubtless contributed to the supremacy
of France in music and the liberal arts. When the See was restored
to Rome, in 1377, Paris and her school of music were relegated to
the background. From this period on it was but a matter of time for
these pupils to carry the centre of musical culture from Paris to
a place possessing a foundation for musical growth, and a greater
number of strong minded scholars, and where political conditions were
favorable. The Netherlands surpassed Paris in all of these important
particulars, though not at the time when the Paris School ceased to be
of importance. There was a school of transition which filled the space
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
left between the important work of Paris and the supremacy of the
Netherlands; that school was the Gallo-Belgic, located northeast from
Paris on the borderline between France and Belgium, Tournay being the
centre. The school at Paris was occupied in acquiring material for use;
the school of the Netherlands developed polyphonic music emotionally;
the step from acquisition to arrangement of material was necessary
before emotional development could occur, and that was the work of the
Gallo-Belgic School. This school was located in the country of Hucbald
and Odo, who had built up there, a little while before, a system of
music which was the foundation of the polyphonic style, and which had
prepared the people for a culture of greater value and importance.
Thus we see that musical development followed the line of greatest
preparation, and utilized the preparatory work furnished by these two
men. And finally, it was a direct step toward the Netherlands which
were even then beginning the struggle in which they were victorious,
for supremacy in commerce, art, and music.</p>
<p><b>Contribution of the Paris School</b>.—When the Paris school ceased
to be of utmost importance to the world of music it had bequeathed to
the later schools Measured Music, and its forms of Organum, Motet,
Conductus and Roundel, and the use of certain not unpleasing intervals,
though occasional consecutive fourths, fifths, and octaves appeared.
It was, then, the business of the Gallo-Belgic school to refine these
intervals, develop measured music, and so improve and develop these
old primary forms, eliminating some and evolving others, as to give
the school of the Netherlands, one century later, forms pleasing in
intervals and of sufficient unity and design to afford opportunity for
the infusion of the emotional. In the matter of intervals much was done
to develop and use the old ones, excepting the consecutive fourths and
fifths which were abolished never to appear again, and many new, or
previously unused intervals, were made use of. In the matter of forms,
we hear no more of the crude Organum and Conductus, but a little about
the Motet, and nothing at all in regard to the Roundel, as such. It is,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
however, due entirely to this last form that polyphonic music
developed; though we hear no more of the Roundel, we do hear much in
regard to the Canon, and the Canon was but a highly developed species
of the Roundel.</p>
<p><b>Imitation and the Canon</b>.—The use of Imitation, as we have
seen, gradually became more and more important. The old monks, in the
very beginning, imitated melody in the fourth and fifth; at the time
of the Paris school these melodies were combined with new ones making
Imitation with more than one melody, though the melody underwent no
real organic development. Now we see in the inception of the Canon a
development of real Imitation of only one melody, but given <i>Variety</i>
by use of the devices of Inversion, Augmentation, Diminution, etc. And
not only did this occur in the Canon, but we find it also in the other
forms, in a freer style, adding materially to the <i>Unity</i>. Imitation is
the foundation principle of polyphonic music, and this principle was
present in the crude efforts of the old monks, in the more intelligent
efforts of the Paris school, and now for the first time, receives, in
the Gallo-Belgic school, a partial recognition of its real value, and a commensurate use.</p>

<p>Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page 315, extract from a chanson by
Dufay. Figure 1 shows the principal melody, figure 2 shows the same
at the fifth below. The entire chanson is quoted in Naumann with the
various imitations fairly well marked; the student should refer to it.</p>
<p><b>The Value of Imitation</b>.—We must understand, however, that mere
Imitation is in itself not a remarkable phenomenon. We imitate, more or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
less unconsciously, in all arts, and even in our daily habits; but this
would be of no lasting importance did we not take that imitation as a
foundation for future development, as did the composers of this school.
And in these polyphonic schools the imitation was unintentional, as a
definite aid to the structure of a musical idea, until it was seen that
the <i>imitation</i> must be <i>confined</i> to <i>one definite idea</i> or melody.
It was then that the original treatment of melodic development began,
and the various devices for developing a melody, without changing its
organic structure, inaugurated. This marked the beginning of a school
of musical art, a school of definite, and not chance evolution; or in
other words, arrangement and development of the earlier acquired ideas.</p>
<p><b>A Technical Principle</b>.—A little consideration will show how
the principle of Imitation was developed. The first step was to
imitate a melody at a lower or higher pitch and sing the two or more
versions <i>simultaneously</i>; the next step was to bring in the second
and other imitating voices <i>successively</i>, at the same or different
pitch; thus making the imitation more prominent. So long as composers
confined their efforts to using fixed melodies, they could not go
far. When they began to adapt well-known melodies and later to invent
their own it became possible to make a lengthy work, this leading to
a composition in which each of the accompanying voices imitated the
first; sometimes only two voices used imitation, the other having a
somewhat free part. A next step was to <i>vary</i> the <i>imitation</i>, by
changing the motion of the imitating part; if the melody moved up, the
imitating part moved downward and <i>vice versa</i>; sometimes the movement
was reversed, the imitation beginning with the last note of the phrase
and proceeding to the first; sometimes it was made in notes of smaller
value (diminution), sometimes in larger (augmentation). These and other
devices were experimented with and worked out by the Gallo-Belgic
composers. One readily sees that this is <i>intellectual</i> work, that it
puts a premium on cleverness and lays expression aside. Yet the technic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of an art must first be acquired and the composers of this period were
doing this in working out a system of technic in composition with
Imitation as the foundation.</p>

page 321, Vol. I, showing at 1 and 2 the principal melody and its
imitation, and at 3, imitation and inversion. The student should
examine the entire example in Naumann.</p>
<p><b>The Work of the Gallo-Belgic School</b>.—We note that many of
the new ideas came into being at this time, all of them, however,
tending toward the arranging of material or the preparing of it for
the emotional style. The Canon, and the principle of Imitation,
developed a set of strict rules which tended to produce more adequate
command of material and assisted in shaping the Fugue; though we, in
our own day, regard these rules as positively detrimental to the real
expression of emotion, yet they were necessary adjuncts to the real
command of <i>technic</i>. With Imitation came Counterpoint of a more highly
developed form; an inevitable step toward the fugal style of the later
polyphonic periods. And lastly came a use of <i>Folk-music melodies</i> and
the <i>Leading Tone</i>, important because they foreshadow the abandonment
of the old Church Modes, and the <i>adoption of the Natural Scale</i>.
This marks the important point in the Gallo-Belgic school; for with
the introduction of the Natural Scale there came increasing tendency
for emotional expression, which could never have occurred had the
Church Modes retained their former position in music. The idea of this
preparation of material for emotional development cannot be emphasized
too strongly. Upon the Gallo-Belgic school rested the burden of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
preparing this material for the later schools, so that these could
demonstrate to the world that while polyphonic music could not be
surpassed as a means of expressing certain impersonal, almost religious
emotions, it could not express to the fullest, the intimate, personal,
emotional ideas of the romantic composers.</p>
<p><b>The Men</b>.—The men of this period are more important than any
that have yet been mentioned, and for that reason require more detailed
study. <b>H. de Zeelandia</b> (13—-1370), a native of Flanders, was a
teacher and composer, and author of a theoretical treatise with musical
examples, “De Musica”; with him the use of consecutive fourths, fifths
and octaves almost disappears, though it remained for a later composer
to abolish these entirely. <b>Guillaume Dufay</b> (1355-1435) was the
one to whom this reform must be finally accredited. He used in place
of the old church form of Cantus Firmus, the popular melodies of the
people with their tendency toward the Natural Scale and the use of
the Leading Tone and its decisive tonality; it may be said that these
melodies were not used in their entirety, or even in their original
form, the rhythm and meter oftentimes being altered so that the airs
were hardly recognizable, though the essential parts were there. It is
Dufay who is responsible for the first intelligent use of Imitation as
a basis for the Canon. <b>Gilles (Ægidius) Binchois</b> (1400-1465) was
a noted composer and, with Dufay, a joint founder of the Gallo-Belgic
school. He is said to have been a soldier before he entered the Church,
and must have been of a light-hearted disposition, as he was called
“the father of joyousness.” He was the teacher of Okeghem, Firmin
Caron and of Busnois. <b>Antoine de Busnois</b> (1440-1481) was the
last famous master of this school before it was merged into the school
of the Netherlands. In his works one can note a further progress
in smoothness of style and examples of well managed imitation. The
character of the latter is so scholarly and so clearly not a matter
of improvisation that we must consider him a man given to study and
reflection, just the kind of character to give scientific study to the principle of Imitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Importance of this School</b>.—This school occupied only a
short period of time (1360-1460), as compared to some of the other
schools; but in that time much was done. The material taken from the
Paris school was great and capable of being developed, though it was
encumbered by unusual intervals and a prejudice against the more
euphonious ones, and by a number of obsolete forms; so obsolete, in
fact, that with perhaps one exception, the Motet, none lasted until
the time of Bach. But the use of Imitation and Measured Music was
sufficient for the men of the Gallo-Belgic school, and with this
as a foundation, and the constantly-increasing tendency to use the
Folk-music and the Natural Scale, they succeeded in so arranging their
material that the men of the Netherlands had but to infuse emotion to
make it produce great music. Dufay and his contemporaries had done this
much: to create organically well-ordered tone combinations agreeable
both in melodic and harmonic relations. Both artists and public found
pleasure in the many transitions, the free use of suspensions, the
altered tones and chords borrowed from other scales, in the ensemble
of these methods which did not give rise in reality to chord-relations
as we understand them, yet suggested something of the kind, and
particularly were they pleased with the use of the variety-giving
changing notes. Because the Gallo-Belgic school did not invent new
forms, or develop old forms to a high degree of perfection, is no
reason why it should not be given a high rank among polyphonic schools,
for the process of refining and transition is often more difficult than
that of inventing.</p>

<p>The reader can appreciate that the condition of France and Paris was
not favorable to the growth of art at this period, which was one of
wars between England and France in the territories of the latter. In
1346, Edward III of England won the battle of Crécy; the struggle was
continued for the next hundred years at intervals, when the appearance
of Joan of Arc (1412-1431) assisted the French. Monasteries were left
unmolested, hence the monks near the Belgian border were able to work
in comparative peace and quiet.

<h2>LESSON XI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The English School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The English Polyphonic School</b> is at once the least important and
the most peculiar of all the schools of the Polyphonic Period. It is
usually ignored by the writers on early music, not because there was
no musical culture, but because there was not continuous and original
development. English writers on this phase of musical development are
too apt, through a pardonable pride of nationality, to exaggerate the
value of British music, and in consulting such authorities, one should
be careful to examine thoroughly all proofs of a dominant national
school and discard such statements as are not perfectly authenticated.
It is hardly the Englishman’s fault that he has had no definite culture
which he may call genuinely English, for native composers have had more
encouragement in England than usually falls to the lot of a creative
musician. Indeed, England has always been a patron of the best in
music, native or foreign, and no one nation has, as a whole, been more
generous in appreciation; her treatment of Beethoven on his death-bed
is a notable example of disinterested generosity. But in real,
original, creative art England has had no great past; and especially is
this true of the Polyphonic Period.</p>
<p><b>A Warlike People</b>.—This is almost entirely due to her
geographical position; there are many other reasons but they are almost
all dependent on this one, and so must be treated in a subordinate
sense. In her early days, England’s position served as a protection and
kept intact her wealth of native Folk-music; but with the advent of
the Romans and the spread of the knowledge of her natural wealth, came
invasion after invasion. Since the first invasion, England has never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
been at peace; she has either been busily engaged in repelling the
enemy from her own shores, or aiding in a conquest of some less
fortunate foe. These wars and conquests not only served to cultivate
a militant and restless spirit, but also produced a race of fighters
from natural inclination. Look at the warlike Angles and Saxons,
note the mixture of Romans, Normans, Dutch and Huguenots, all at
the zenith of their fighting powers, and then cease to wonder that
England’s greatness has been in the power to fight, to govern, to make
conquests, rather than to cultivate art. England, when she reached the
stage of conquering rather than defending, began to give, more than
to acquire, and never reached the acquisitive stage until the present
time with Elgar and the lesser lights of the new school, unless we
except Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the realm of literature.
England’s cathedrals are but the results of European cathedral building
and the unity of Government and Church; had the Church and State always
been separate, it is safe to say that England would have waited much
longer for her cathedrals.</p>
<p><b>The Kindred Arts</b>.—Literature was the only exception; and
it is not necessary to seek for a further reason than the fact
that Literature, as an art, always developed before Music. Art, in
painting, was in the early days borrowed from other countries, and
not until modern times did England acquire a national school of
Painting; a noteworthy fact, for like Literature, such an art almost
always precedes a national culture of Music. But these examples of
the evolution of the kindred arts of Literature and Painting are
encouraging rather than discouraging, for, having attained a high
standard in these, England may now hope to develop a national culture
of Music. In Music much the same conditions obtained as in Literature
and Painting. With the exception of one or two isolated composers, and
these trained in foreign schools, England always borrowed her music;
note for example, Handel, Buononcini, Mendelssohn, to quote just a few
noteworthy foreign composers. Each race as it conquered England brought
its own music. St. Augustine sang a Gregorian chant as he entered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Canterbury; the Normans and the Dutch had their own music; and Italian
and German music long held the boards in England. Thus little time
was spent in developing a native music, because the frequent wars and
political troubles directed the strength into other channels than
those of art; the proximity of a higher culture in Europe, and the
tendencies of England’s foreign rulers, enabled them to import and
subsist on foreign music when they should have been developing a native
style. And finally, the isolation of England in the early days, later
became an actual help to the acquirement of an alien style, because of
the absolute necessity for students to live abroad to acquire musical learning.</p>
<p><b>Native Musical Life</b>.—There was a certain amount of native
musical life, but this did not tend to produce music along the
conventional lines. Of Folk-music there was much, and the development,
as a general rule, was aided rather than retarded by the conquests,
though the combination of Folk-music of different nationalities does
not usually tend to aid its unified evolution. The only real example
of noteworthy writing, in the early polyphonic school, is the canon
“Sumer is icumen in,” dated 1228, and attributed to an early English
writer. There is no proof excepting the fact that the manuscript is in
English, that the canon is of English origin; neither is there proof to
the contrary. Single instances, however, do not prove the existence of
an original school; and especially is this the case when that school,
in its writings, far surpasses any other school of that period of
which we know. In spite of the fact of the English text, and that this
canon may be but one of many surviving the destruction of the English
monasteries, impartial historians believe most strongly that the canon
is of French origin, reset to English words and carried to England by a
student of the Paris school. The Paris school was at its height at this
time, and was the only school of such writing in the world; and while
we have no other example of that school equal to this canon, yet it is
easier to believe it to be French than English, for England had no such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
school at all. She had musicians (like Odington), but they were all
pupils of the Paris school; and even had this work been produced in
England, it would be safer to credit it to the Paris school, for the
man who wrote it would, almost of necessity, have studied there. The
only other way of accounting for it is to presume the date to be too early.</p>
<p class="space-below2">It is but fair to say that while this canon <i>may</i> owe
its origin to the principles of the Gallo-Belgic school, it stands alone as an
article of historical interest to the musician. Nowhere on the Continent has a
work of equal importance of so early a date been brought to view. Mr.
Wm. Chappell, the English antiquarian, brought to light several other
productions of early English composers, including a hymn in English,
scored for two voices, and another in Latin, for three voices. The
manuscript has been definitely attributed to the middle of the 13th
century. There can be little doubt that when so many monasteries,
with their treasures of learning, were suppressed and their inmates
scattered, in the time of Henry VIII, owing to the national change from
the Romish faith, many valuable manuscripts that would today have the
utmost interest to the musical historian were destroyed.</p>

Whether this is purely English or not matters little, for it is a fine
specimen and exemplifies Walter Odington’s rule for the construction of
a Roundel, cited in a former lesson. This is more than a mere roundel,
having not only a little Inversion and much Imitation, managed in a
most ingenious manner, but also the whole canon is founded on a ground
bass in two parts, themselves in canonic form. This bass consists
of the regulation metrical form as seen at A and the following two
measures, has one measure forming a connecting passage, thus bringing
in the portion marked B which is the same as A only a fifth higher;
the whole forms a remarkable evidence of an early conception of the
relation of the Tonic and Dominant, hardly to be believed. This
metrical form is introduced, slightly changed and inverted, in the
upper voices at A and B. The first voice states in all five melodies
and the other voices follow at intervals of 4, 8, and 12 measures; in
ending voice number two omits part of theme V, voice number three all
of it and voice number four all of V and the imitation of the metrical bass.</p>
<p>Outside this one example, England produced little but moderately
good polyphonic music in the form of motets and madrigals, and in
the time of Gibbons and Purcell, sonatas and operas. There were also
anthems, the old plain chant and much Folk-music, but nothing that
can be considered as important. The Folk-music is all that can claim
originality, and that ranks favorably with the best examples of other
nations and is, indeed, in advance of that of other nations considered
more musical.</p>
<p><b>The Men of the Time</b>.—While English music was not, at this
period, very important, there were many composers whose names at least
should be familiar. After the passing of the bards and minstrels,
the monks controlled the composing of music until the dissolution of
the monasteries, when it passed into the hands of the schoolmen of
Cambridge and Oxford, where it remains today, though there are, at
present, signs of an important awakening, presaging the passing of
musical power from the hands of the conservative doctors of Oxford and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Cambridge, to the present generation of younger and more talented
writers. <b>Walter Odington</b> (1180-1250) was a pupil of the
Paris school and a theorist of note, writing on the Mensural System
as exploited in the French school. <b>Robert DeHandlo</b> (1326)
was another theoretician who wrote on the same subject. <b>John
Dunstable</b> (1400-1458) was contemporaneous with the men of the
Gallo-Belgic school and did the same for English music in reforming it
as the latter did for the foreign school. In recent years examples of
his writings have been unearthed in the cathedral libraries of Trent
and Bologna, as well as elsewhere, making it clear that in his lifetime
he was regarded as one of the foremost composers of Europe. The
theorist, Tinctoris, of the Netherlands school, considered in the next
lesson, speaks of the “source and origin of the new art [Counterpoint]
being among the English, the foremost of whom is John Dunstable.”
A contemporary who was also well-known in Italy was John Hothby,
who wrote several treatises on music. There were other musicians of
prominence prior to the Reformation under Henry VIII, but we know
little about them save their names. <b>John Merbecke</b> (1515-1585)
adapted the Gregorian chant to the English prayer book, which was
published in 1550. <b>Christopher Tye</b> (1515-1580) was a teacher and
wrote much church music; so also was <b>Thomas Tallis</b> (1515-1585),
one of the most learned composers of his time, who set the choral
portions in the service to music. He is noted for a celebrated canon in
forty parts and for a hymn-tune, known as “Tallis” or “Evening Hymn,”
which contains a canon between the soprano and tenor parts. <b>William
Byrd</b> (1538-1623) was another noted composer of this school, being
also famous as a writer of instrumental music. Queen Elizabeth granted
to Tallis and Byrd the exclusive right to print music and to rule music
paper. <b>Orlando Gibbons</b> (1583-1625) wrote motets and madrigals
and is known as a writer of both polyphonic and monophonic music.
<b>Henry Purcell</b> (1658-1695) was the greatest composer of the
English Polyphonic school, writing operas in the English and Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
style, songs, sonatas, motets and anthems. He seems to have been in
many respects a very able writer and musician, but died too young to
make any decided impression on his times.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>.—From this it will be seen that while England had a
musical people composed of a mixture of the most musical peoples of
Europe, yet because of geographical position, political disturbances,
religious troubles and wars, she was never able to produce a great
and commanding school. She did not lack force, but it was directed
into other, and for the time being, more important channels. Almost
everything of an artistic nature was borrowed, or was a transplanted
culture; and while the art of music never lacked men to cultivate
it, yet these men were not of the calibre of the men employed in the
other works of the nation, so that so far as the Polyphonic period
is concerned, England is not important, and but for such men as
Dunstable and Purcell and the canon “Sumer Is Icumen In,” England
might be completely ignored in respect to her influence on polyphonic development.</p>

<h2>LESSON XII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The School of the Netherlands</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Dominance of the Netherlands</b>.—The most important asset of
a nation is its commercial activity, for upon that depends its art
life. The fine arts are to an extent luxuries, and until a nation has,
by commercial activity, acquired wealth, they cannot be earnestly
cultivated, for all arts require from the artist his entire time and
life, and until there is money and inclination enough among the people
to support an artist in his commercially non-productive state, there
can be no art; hence we see a shifting of art centres in the Middle
Ages, just as the commercial centres changed.</p>
<p>The Netherlands were preëminently fitted to carry on great commercial
pursuits by virtue of their geographical situation and long combat
and association with the sea. Possessing the natural outlet to a
great part of Europe, it was reasonable that the Netherlands should
play an important part in the Hanseatic League, and that her fleets
should trade on every sea and her coffers be enriched by barter in
the produce of every clime. It was a golden age for the Lowlands,
from 1350 to 1625, for their trade made them one of the wealthiest
and most important nations in the world. Their situation between
the trading countries of the South and the North made them, as it
were, the commercial exchange of Europe. The consequent wealth could
not lie dormant, therefore much of it was used in building notable
architectural structures, encouraging Painting, and developing the then
infant art of Music. It is unnecessary to mention the famous structures
which were the result of this period, and it is but necessary to name
Hubert Van Eyck, Rubens, Van Dyck, to understand the prominence given
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to the art of Painting by the acquisition of this enormous wealth. And
it is largely due to this commercial activity that the school of the
Netherlands attained such an undying fame.</p>
<p>One other influence, and that dependent on commercial activity,
produced great results. Art is not sectional, it is universal;
and great art works are produced not by local influences but by
association, or contact, with the world. For this reason, the
intercourse with the entire world generated by the great commercial
activity of the times produced the first great world School of Music.
Intercourse developed emotion and produced broader and less localized
view-points of life: it brought into close association the art life of
different nations and infused a unity of emotion wherever it occurred.
In short, Music, by being brought into contact with the ideas of the
world instead of a local association, took on a universal form and
feeling never before felt and never to be relinquished. For this
reason, Music unconsciously advanced from Paris to the Netherlands,
toward the greater sphere of influence, stopping for only a short
period with the Gallo-Belgic school, where it was prepared technically
for its new growth as a world form.</p>
<p><b>The Gallo-Belgic and the Netherlands Schools Compared</b>.—The
Gallo-Belgic school, in the control of churchmen, was isolated from
any influence tending to develop a broad emotional scheme. And it is
doubtful whether it could have caused any change in musical evolution,
for the technical forms were not ready. And so the Gallo-Belgic school,
in its retirement from the great world activities, confined itself to
attaining the power to manipulate notes, for the sake of mere technical
effects, leaving emotional development entirely out of consideration.
With such a school, while its work was important, no real art feeling
could be gained; and so the school of the Netherlands marks the
departure into a new romantic school governed, to a great extent, by
the emotional. The Netherlands, because of their more comprehensive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
view of the musical activities of the past and their constant
intercourse, commercially and artistically, with all nations, acquired
a more human sense of the beauty of music, and ceased to manipulate
musical material for technical ends, producing instead of cold,
lifeless forms, music pulsing with vigor, life and emotion. With this
primary change of view-point came a direct growth of form, the Canon
being perfected and immediately giving birth to the Fugue; the Madrigal
and Canzona and many other lesser forms sprang into being, all capable
of emotional development, and almost immediately producing great
results. For the first time music was free from consecutive fourths,
fifths and octaves because composers created from the standpoint of
emotional beauty and not that of technical utility. The result was a
musical technic capable of development, and refined beyond need of
further reformation.</p>
<p><b>The Organ and its Influence</b>.—The organ was the third great
reformative power in this epoch. All music was vocal and no other
conception could be had, for effective instruments and instrumental
music were not yet in existence. The organ, because its tones were
suited to accompanying the human voice and because its tone color was
closely identical with that of the voice, was readily adapted to the
vocal forms then in use. This gave a greater resource, for what was
often technically impossible with the human voice became easy with
the organ. The mechanical improvement of this instrument immediately
gave greater freedom and range of technic, and it proved so well
suited to polyphonic development that it aided the evolution more than
any other one agency. The use of the organ must not be accounted as
the beginning of instrumental music, for the organ used only adapted
voice-forms, such as the Canon, Fugue, Madrigal, etc.; for this reason
it is to be doubted if it aided in emotional development except by
making technical resources much less restricted. In this sense, then,
the technic of this school was freed from most of its former rules, and
Music, previously cramped by narrow vocal restrictions, passed into the
comparative freedom of the polyphonic style of the organ.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Men of this School</b> are hardly to be separated from the men
of the Gallo-Belgic school. The work passes from one school to the next
with little or no perceptible pause, and the first men of the later
school are pupils or disciples of the last men of the Gallo-Belgic
period. Another noteworthy fact is, that so great was the musical
growth, of this school and the skill and learning of its followers that
the composers of the Netherlands expatriated themselves and settled in
all parts of Europe, founding famous schools in Paris, Madrid, Naples,
Venice, Munich and Rome; the celebrated <i>Italian school</i> is really an
<i>offshoot</i> of that of the <i>Netherlands</i>. It is this overflow which
marks this school as the greatest of the early polyphonic schools and
shows why and how it acquired its emotional supremacy. <b>Jean de
Okeghem</b> (1430-1512), pupil of Binchois, was the first prominent
worker. It is difficult to class him as a composer of the Belgian or
Netherlands school, for he has the earmarks of both. He lived during
the supremacy of the Netherlands, but worked with the material of the
Belgians. He developed the Canon to its highest technical point and
took the first step toward the originating of the Fugue. To him is due
the credit of introducing the use of retrograde, inverted, diminished
and augmented imitation in the Canon. Much of his work was done in
France. The tendency of his teaching was toward artificiality, as he
delighted in puzzle canons and other exhibitions of ingenuity.</p>
<p><b>Antonius Brumel</b> (1460-1520), a pupil of Okeghem, is noteworthy
because of a foreshadowing of the use of chords in real harmonic
progressions.</p>

the polyphonic writers. The rest of the composition is strictly in the polyphonic style.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Jakob Hobrecht</b> (1430-1506) was the first real Dutch composer,
and is noted, in his use of technical forms, for their emotional beauty
rather than mechanical excellence.</p>

<p>Part of a composition by Hobrecht, cited by Naumann, “History of
Music,” Vol. I, page 331. Excerpt shows how strictly even this fragment
is written and yet how musical it is. At 1 is shown a figure in the
bass repeated in imitation a step higher at 2. At A is shown a melody
imitated at B in augmentation and with altered rhythm. The student
should refer to Naumann.</p>
<p>This is truly a remarkable work for that period, and shows that even
then composers were beginning to observe the emotional power of chord
relationship.</p>
<p><b>Johann Tinctor</b> (1446-1511), a disciple of Okeghem, worked in
Rome and Naples, and will be considered with the Italian school.
<b>Josquin de Pres</b> (1450-1521), also a disciple of Okeghem, worked
in Rome and Paris, and must also be considered as one of the Italian
school. It may be here mentioned that he was one of the first to use
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
music as a vehicle for expressing human emotions rather than technical
power. He summed up in himself all the harmonic science of the 15th
century. He was renowned through all Europe as a composer, and if
his music seems to us somewhat dry and pedantic there is abundant
testimony to the deep impression it made upon his contemporaries, which
is a test of its power to excite and to express emotion. Compared
with the works of his predecessors and even the majority of his
contemporaries, Josquin’s writings show freedom from the bonds of the
old scholasticism, greater simplicity and esthetic beauty. Among those
of his works that have come to us is a <i>Miserere</i> for five voices,
and an <i>Ave Maria</i> that cannot be considered other than lovely music.
<b>Nicholas Gombert</b> (1495-1570), a pupil of Josquin de Pres, had
a natural, tuneful and flowing style similar to that afterwards shown
by Palestrina. His work was done in Madrid, and to him Spain and
Portugal owe all they have of the ancient polyphonic music. <b>Jacob
Arkadelt</b> (1492-1570) and <b>Claude Goudimel</b> (1510-1572) worked
in Rome, <b>Adrian Willaert</b> (1480-1562) and <b>Cyprian de Rore</b>
(1516-1565) in Venice, and will be considered with the Italian school.
<b>Orlando di Lasso</b> (1520-1594) worked some in Italy, but mostly
in Munich, where his influence was great. His style was broad, flowing
and especially emotional, and as a writer of the Netherlands school
his name stands as one of the very highest. <b>J. P. Sweelinck</b>
(1562-1621) is the last, and while of the Netherlands, studied in
Venice, but did his work at home. He was a great organist and the last
great master of the school, and had the honor of being the link between
it and the German school, serving as an example for Sebastian Bach. His
works have recently been published in Germany. Of all these men it may
be said that they developed music steadily toward the goal of emotional freedom.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>.—The great work of this school was to make <i>technic
subservient to thought</i>. In all preceding schools, the material and
the forms were so new and the methods of handling them so crude,
that technic always dominated thought. And it was naturally so, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
expression cannot come until the power to master the material has been
attained; it was by this power that the Netherlands developed emotional
music. But the student invariably objects and says he does not see any
emotion in the polyphonic music of this period! The student must place
himself in the position of these old masters, supported by the church
and constantly imbibing the religious atmosphere of the institution
they served, until they unconsciously expressed, in their music, the
grandeur and power of their religion rather than the intimate personal
feeling of modern musicians; and then the student will understand
what is meant by polyphonic emotion. We must always remember that
<i>polyphonic emotion is not monophonic emotion</i>, and that its tremendous
technic and complexity of device were but the means of expressing
its peculiar form of emotion, which to understand, one must study
diligently, and then approach with a reverent feeling.</p>

figure that will be most familiar is Christopher Columbus, whose life
and work covered the early period, the close of the old polyphonic
school dating with Palestrina’s death in 1594, 100 years after the
discovery of America. This hundred years represents the flowering time of polyphony as an art.

<h2>LESSON XIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Italian School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Italy the New Centre</b>.—Music developed in the Netherlands
because of commercial supremacy and the consequent world association.
We shall now see it pass to Italy, but because of a very different
reason. From the earliest Christian days Italy was the centre of
religious influence; it is only necessary to examine history to
observe the ramifications of that power in England, France, Germany,
the Netherlands and other countries. This influence, often more
political than religious in character, gave to the Italian Church
(then the Italian State), a predominance of authority, which was a
great power in religious and secular thought. This influence spread to
music for various reasons. We must remember that the school at Paris
was controlled by the Church, that the Gallo-Belgic school owed its
foundation to the same cause, and that the men of all three schools
were employed as organists by the Church. It is true that in Italy the
Church had not the broadening influence of commercial intercourse, but
was more than compensated for that lack by what we may call artistic
intercourse. The Church was the one stable institution in these times
of war in which painters could find a refuge for their works, and from
which patronage flowed in a steady stream to the ever-needy artists.
Thus was caused and maintained the artistic atmosphere necessary to
the cultivation of Music. As an art, the Church was the only support
of artistic music. When Music originated it needed an institution to
protect and foster it and safeguard its growth, and this it found in
the Church; it repaid this protection by evolving a style eminently
suited to the needs of the Church, but absolutely useless for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
expression of secular and natural emotion. To this patronage of its
peculiar art is due the importation into Italy of the best in music
wherever found, to aid in these services. And so we find singers from
the Netherlands engaged for the Church in Italy. This, and the fame of
Italy as the home of superior singers, undoubtedly led the majority of
those numerous Netherlandish masters to seek their homes abroad, and
preferably in Italy. The fact that all music was vocal in style and
that the Church was the only institution capable of supporting such
a style, cannot be too strongly stated; for upon that depended not
only the evolution of Music, but also the very life of the Polyphonic
emotional style.</p>
<p><b>Emotion in Polyphony</b>.—This style is worthy of examination.
As a preface we must remember that we have to deal with the Church
and <i>human voices only</i>, for instruments had not been perfected
sufficiently for church use, excepting the organ, and that we must
consider a voice because of its peculiar tonal qualities and the
adaptation of vocal forms and styles to its use. This vocal style
had developed gradually, through a long course of reforms, until it
reached its perfection in the later polyphonic schools, and expressed
the peculiar emotion suited for the services. <i>Lack</i> of <i>rhythm</i> was
a pointed <i>characteristic</i>; for, in the first place, it had been
discarded as profane, and in the next place, a long course of treatment
in the management of voices to avoid anything like concerted and
accentuated dissonances had produced a peculiar flowing movement which,
however smooth it might be, certainly possessed no rhythmic force.
Then, too, the old scale forms caused anything written in their idioms
to sound grave, severe and dignified, if not harsh. The transition
to the modern major and minor in the Monophonic school of 1600 and
the immediate cultivation of music by the people may be taken as an
example of the musical qualities of the two modes. All of these causes
tended to produce a suitable form of music and an emotional expression
peculiarly suited to the Roman services. In this style there was little
storm and stress, little of the personal appeal to God; on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
hand, it was grave, severe and immovable, or in a better sense,
impersonal in its expression. Music of the polyphonic period,
even until the time of Sebastian Bach, in whose works it is well
exemplified, does not show us the appeal to God from the heart of the
active Christian worker, but rather the appeal to a vast impersonal
and majestic God far removed from the needs and supplications of the
mere individual. It was this kind of emotion that developed in the
Italian Polyphonic schools. The human and more expressive emotion of
the schools of the Netherlands was transmitted, in the schools of the
Italian, into the high, contemplative moods of religious expression;
and it was well that it should be so, for polyphonic music could
never have expressed the emotion of a Beethoven; and it was not only
best that it should express its own peculiar style of emotion, but
inevitable that it should do so.</p>

<b>Schools Outside Italy</b>.—The overflow from the Netherlands
concentrated its efforts on certain points or school centres. In Italy,
these were Naples, Venice and Rome. There were others throughout
Europe, such as Madrid, Paris and Munich, which we must consider first
because of their relation to Italy. <b>Nicholas Gombert</b> (1495-1570)
influenced the polyphonic development in Madrid, but so isolated was
the work that nothing great resulted. <b>Okeghem</b> (1430-1512) worked
longer in Paris than other masters, though several lived there for
short intervals, such as Arkadelt and Goudimel. <b>Orlando di Lasso</b>
(1520-1594) did almost all his work in Munich and established the most
important school outside of Italy. He was a most prolific writer and
can be compared in ability and style to Palestrina. His style was broad
and bold and contained much of that serious and earnest character now
attributed to his Teutonic associations. He wrote in all known forms
and was well nigh universal in his knowledge of form, technic and
expression. His facility in the art of writing was very great and was
fully equalled by his love for work. Although his work has somewhat
less perfection than that of his great contemporary, Palestrina, it has
astonishing power of expression. It shows the force of his genius that
he was able to make his works in the strict contrapuntal forms full
of real feeling. He was a man of interesting personal character. The
most famous of his works is his setting of seven “Penitential Psalms,”
containing a number of most curious effects for unaccompanied voices,
with much that is singularly characteristic and beautiful, and showing
well the character of his genius.</p>
<p>We give part of a composition by di Lasso showing his broad style and
the increasing use of what sounds suspiciously like our modern chord
progressions. The lack of rhythmic effect and the holding over of notes
past the accented beat is shown in this exercise. The whole example,
with words, may be found in Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page 387.

</div>
<p><b>The Italian School</b>.—But it is with the Italian schools that
we are most concerned. The school at Naples had as its principal
master <b>Johannes Tinctoris</b> (1446-1511) a Fleming by birth, a
doctor of laws and a mathematician, one of those peculiar combinations
seldom noticed after the Paris school, and almost sure to mark the
theoretician. His work was principally theoretical and his treatises
are of great value. <b>Adrian Willaert</b> (1480-1562), born at
Bruges, was a pupil of Jean Mouton, at Paris. After visiting Rome and
Ferrara, he settled in Venice and, as organist of St. Mark’s, founded
an important school. He introduced the use of large double choruses
which caused him to write harmonically rather than polyphonically. This
influence caused him to relegate the imitative polyphonic part writing
to smaller forms (motets, etc.) and to write plain chord progressions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in his larger works; and before long he began to observe and to use the
relationship between the Tonic and the Dominant. This tendency and the
invention of the Madrigal furnished the basis for a new instrumental
school at a later date. His best-known pupil, <b>Cipriano di Rore</b>
(1516-1565), was short-lived, and worked in both Venice and Parma. He
made some investigation into the use of chromatics, thus showing the
growing tendency to abandon the Church modes for the natural scales.
Following these Dutch masters came the two Gabrieli’s, who were native
Italians. <b>Andrea Gabrieli</b> (1510-1586) was a great organist
and wrote in the style of Willaert, his famous master. <b>Giovanni
Gabrieli</b> (1557-1613) was a pupil of his uncle Andrea, and carried
the latter’s methods further toward perfection. He also wrote for
instruments in conjunction with voices, abandoning to a certain extent
the <i>a capella</i> style, and opening that epoch of instrumental music
foreshadowed by Willaert in his madrigals. Rome was the centre of
church government, of church art and also of church music, and as
such, had the largest and greatest of Italian music schools. <b>Jacob
Arkadelt</b> (1492-1570), a Netherlander, lived nineteen years in
Rome and did most of his work there; he wrote both secular and sacred
compositions in the strict polyphonic style, and in that of Willaert.
<b>Claude Goudimel</b> (1510-1572), though a prominent master in
Paris, worked much in Rome and was the teacher of Palestrina. He set
to music in four parts metrical versions of the Psalms, published in
1565. In him is to be observed that clearness of expression and beauty
of melodic flow with which Palestrina attained such a high point of expression.</p>
<p class="space-below1"><b>Palestrina</b>.—It remained for his pupil
<b>Palestrina</b>, (Giovanni Pierlugi Sante, 1514-1594) an Italian,
to reach the highest point of emotional expression and technical
freedom; we must, however, rank Orlando di Lasso with him. He carried
to the highest fruition the teachings of the Netherlands, tempered by
the romantic and melodic tendency of the Italian nature. His writings
were so free technically that they have been called simple in form;
this they are, but the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> simplicity is the simplicity of
genius. His style is melodic, and has a clearness never attained by any
writer before his time, and yet his music is written in the most severe
forms. He founded a school of music in Rome which, however, never
produced any great masters, for it was the time when the reformation
of Opera began and carried the development of music into other channels.</p>

<p>The end of a composition by Palestrina, showing the melody in the upper
voice instead of the tenor, as was usually the case in polyphonic
compositions, and the use of our modern Minor mode. This composition,
at least this last part of it taken alone, might be by a modern writer,
so familiar do its progressions sound; indeed, the melody of the first
two measures is strikingly similar to a progression used by Beethoven
in one of his string quartets. The entire example with words may be
seen in Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page 510.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>.—The Polyphonic Era has many important characteristics
and results which make it worth while to sum it up. Its development is
largely the history of the <i>development of vocal music</i> to its highest
point, and the consequent failure of it to provide accurate expression
for human needs. It marks the development of scales, intervals, forms,
instruments and emotion. In scales we find the trend to be always
toward the natural; in intervals, toward freedom, using only the ear as
a criterion; in instruments we note the development of the organ, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the lack of others which would have changed music entirely; in emotion,
we note the evolution from crudeness to the highest and most polished
forms of impersonal expression. The lack of the Polyphonic school
was not in the intrinsic value of the music, nor in any lack of the
desire to express emotion; the failure to provide a suitable means of
musical expression was due to the idea of church relation to God rather
than to the personal individualistic relations established by Luther.
<i>After the Reformation</i> music takes up this new idea and immediately
a <i>secular music</i>, vocal and instrumental, begins to <i>develop</i>,
culminating in an emotional school of a totally different and truer
style than the Polyphonic. Polyphonic music expressed the old monkish
ideas of religion perfectly, but monophonic music expresses the emotion
of the people, a universal emotion. Polyphonic music must always be
appreciated for its value, but it must be examined for its fundamental
principles and reasons for being, before it can be understood. Then we
may know its value as a foundation for our modern music.</p>

of the Italian School. The Madrigal</span></span>.</h2>

</div>
<p><b>A Church Composer</b>.—But one master of the Italian Polyphonic
schools is worthy of lengthy notice, more because of his influence on
the music of the Church than his contribution to the new instrumental
school then only in its infancy. Palestrina, while acquainted with
Galilei, the reformer of Opera, and Neri, the originator of Oratorio,
and with many of the men identified with the new style of vocal and
instrumental music, gave his entire life to the composing of Church
music, though in his poverty-stricken condition musical work under
wealthy patronage must have often appealed to him. At any rate, the
farthest he ever strayed from the Church was in the composing of many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
madrigals, in which he excelled; it is almost certain that in these
he unintentionally influenced the development of instrumental music.
For the present, however, a consideration of his life and influence on
Church music is more important. But for him, Church music would have
lacked for at least a century that simple and individual note so often
struck by himself and Bach. Palestrina, by the enormous number of his
masses and by the fertility of his invention, placed the music of the
Latin Church on so high a plane that no composers, at least until the
time of Bach, even approached him, much less equalled him.</p>
<p><b>Giovanni Pierluigi Sante</b>, known as Palestrina, after his
birthplace, was born in 1514 at Palestrina, a small town southeast of
Rome. His parents were peasants and the boy received but the ordinary
education of his class. While very young he seems to have become a
choir-boy at Rome, though it is recorded that his voice was anything
but pleasing. Upon this supposition rests the statement that he was,
for a short time, a pupil of Arkadelt; this is unimportant because
eventually (1540) he became a pupil of Goudimel, whose influence far
overshadowed that of any former teacher. In 1548 he married and four
sons were the result of the union, three, however, dying at an early
age and the fourth proving, in after-life, a worthless fellow. In
1551 he succeeded Arkadelt as choir-master of St. Peter’s; later the
dedication of three masses to Pope Julian III won him a position as
singer in the Papal Choir. Owing to the jealousy of the other singers
he finally lost his position, but received an appointment at the Church
of <i>Santa Maria Maggiore</i> where he stayed for ten years. Naumann says
that in 1565 he received the appointment of master of the Sistine
Chapel, but never occupied the position because of the opposition among
the choir. Grove, however, says that in 1565 he was made composer to
the Pontifical Choir and did not become master until 1585, holding the
position from that time on. In 1571 he was again connected with St.
Peter’s; this also marks his acquaintance with Neri, for whom he wrote
some music, and the founding of a music school, though it cannot have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
amounted to much since most authorities give no particulars in regard
to it. Indeed, it is certain that he cannot have had much influence in
that line, for his pupils, outside of his own family, did not amount
to more than a scant half-dozen. In 1576 he was given the task of
revising the Gradual and Antiphonary of the Latin Church but, with the
assistance of a pupil, finished only a little more than one-half of the
work. He died in 1594 and was buried in the Vatican. His life is marked
by the usual jealousies and quarrels of musicians, though Palestrina
himself seems to have been nobleminded and more than reasonably free
from all such faults. He was in poor circumstances during his life,
and his only living son was a bitter disappointment. Altogether, as we
examine his life we are impressed by many things; first, his apparent
failure from a worldly point of view; secondly, the enormous amount of
composing which he did; and, finally, his devotion to the Church and
her music, and because of it, his glorious success as a musician, and
his undying fame.</p>
<p><b>Reform of Church Music</b>.—The year marking the climax of his
life was 1565. The Council of Trent, by a unanimous vote, decided to
prohibit the use of music in the Church unless some means could be
devised to make it more devotional and suited to its purpose. Naumann
says that it was the desire of the Council of Trent to simplify
the music so that the people might take part in the services; but
Grove claims that it was because of the use of secular music in the
composition of the masses. It seems that it was customary, for part of
the singers at least, to sing in services not only the <i>melodies of</i>
the <i>popular songs</i>, but <i>also</i> the <i>words</i>, thus producing confusion
and defeating the very purpose of the music. In all probability, both
of these reasons had something to do with the edict. It is plain
that the fundamental principle at stake was the lack of the personal
devotional note (which caused this action by the Council of Trent), and
it was the supplying of this want that made Palestrina the saviour of
music in the Church. A committee of Cardinals was appointed to see if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
proper music for the service could be found. They commissioned
Palestrina to write a mass and submit it for trial. When the trial
came, at the home of Cardinal Vitellozzi, Palestrina submitted three
masses, the last of which was the best; this he afterwards called the
“Missa Papæ Marcelli.”</p>
<p><b>Palestrina’s Style</b>.—In these masses Palestrina had succeeded
so well in subordinating technic to expression, and in eliminating
all extraneous matter, that he was hailed as the greatest musician of
the Church, and honors were showered upon him. From this it would be
supposed that Palestrina had shown an entire change in style, yet this
was not the case. Goudimel, his master, shows traces of the so-called
Palestrina style, and Palestrina himself was gradually growing into
that simplicity which marked the music of his later days. This
simplicity was not only simplicity of emotion but also simplicity of
technic; only a man with a most consummate skill could have written
such great music with such little use of showy technic. Palestrina
wrote in all of the polyphonic forms, complex and simple, but he
reached his highest point in his most simple works; and those works
were written for his Church.</p>
<p><b>Secular Art Song</b>.—The secular life of the 15th and 16th
centuries, as well as the Church, had an art music, which, like the
other music of the period was <i>vocal</i>, not solos with accompaniments,
but <i>choral</i>, consisting of three or more parts; this we may call a
species of vocal chamber music. We can trace the development of this
form of musical composition to an application of the principle of
Discant to secular or Folk-melodies. The minstrels, as mentioned in a
previous lesson, were accustomed to improvise accompanying parts to a
familiar song—a favorite custom was that of adding two parts—for the
entertainment of their hearers. This process was not a haphazard one,
but followed fixed rules. The absence of a simple system of notation,
however, prevented the accumulation of musical records. And when
minstrelsy ceased to exist as a calling, only the memory of the crude
attempts of the minstrels remained. But the principle was not lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Fortunately for the good of the art, the trained musicians of the
Church took it up, and, calling to their aid the resources of their
art as used in the music of the Church, applied them all to secular
melodies, the songs of the people.</p>
<p><b>The Predecessors of the Madrigal</b>.—Several of the forms of
secular music found in Italy, the Frottole (song of the mass or
crowd), and the Vilanelle (village or peasant songs), were used in
a crude way by the musicians of the people as airs to which to add
accompanying parts. Both Germans and English made similar use of their
folk melodies. But since the text was usually of a humorous, or a witty
character, the accompanying melodies or “<i>counterpoints</i>” were simple
in style. The work of the trained composers along this line resulted in
the Madrigal, which shows a union of the musical spirit of the people
with the finest poetic art; the melodies had the style of the popular
music, but they were used with technical skill.</p>
<p><b>The Madrigal</b>.—The text of the madrigal was erotic in character,
representing the emotions of a heart filled with noble, often hopeless
love. The Italian poets Tasso and Petrarch were masters in this style
of writing. The name Madrigal was first applied to this kind of
lyric, and afterward became identified with the music itself. There
is disagreement as to the origin of the name, the common explanation
being that it comes from the word <i>mandra</i>, a sheepfold, <i>mandriale</i>,
shepherd, in allusion to the frequent pastoral character of the text.
The Madrigal undoubtedly owes its origin to the composers of the
Flemish school. The musicians of the Netherlands, in the middle of the
15th century, had a polyphonic song, elaborate in construction, in the
old Church modes, modeled doubtless on the plan of the Motet, but using
the melody of some popular song as a <i>Cantus Firmus</i>. When the centre
of musical power was transferred to Italy, the madrigal principle came
into new hands, those of the composers of the Venetian school, who gave
it the character which made it so popular.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Italian School</b>.—The first great composer in this style
was Adrian Willaert. After him came Arkadelt, who published several
books of madrigals. The most famous composer of madrigals was <b>Luca
Marenzio</b> (1560-1599), called by his contemporaries “the sweetest
swan of Italy,” whose works attained extraordinary vogue. They are
extremely melodious. A composer who made considerable use of the
chromatic element was <b>Gesualdo</b>, Prince of Venusia (1560-1614).
Other Italian composers of madrigals are Festa, Palestrina, Anerio,
Waelrant, Orlando di Lasso, Cipriano di Rore, Vecchi and Gastoldi, the
latter being credited with the introduction of the “Fa, la.”</p>
<p><b>The English School</b>.—The Madrigal never displaced the Folk-song
in Germany or the <i>Chanson</i> in France, but it found a home in England,
in which country a number of composers were developed whose best work
is considered to be superior to that of their Italian predecessors. The
period of fifty years, beginning with 1588, when the first collection
of madrigals was published in London, is called the Madrigalian Era.
The composers of prominence are: William Byrd, Thomas Morley, Thomas
Weelkes, John Dowland, John Wilbye, Orlando Gibbons and Richard
Edwardes. So great was the interest in this class of music that it was
considered a necessary part of the education of a gentleman that he
should be able to sing, when requested, a part in a madrigal, as we
learn from a work or music study published by Thomas Morley in 1597.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Madrigal</b>.—The best means of securing an
understanding of the Madrigal style is to study good examples, and,
if possible, to hear them sung by a good choral organization. They
are written in three, four, five and six parts, the five part being
the one most favored. The principle of construction is <i>polyphonic</i>,
imitation being freely used, cross accents being frequent on account of
the syncopated style, each part being conceived as melody, not as the
result of the movement of successive chords.</p>
<p><b>Influence of the Madrigal</b>.—The great number of madrigals
written by so many composers may be taken as an indication of the
growth of musical sensibility. The creative side developed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
composer was no longer contented with taking a melody or some theme
ready made, and elaborating it or accompanying it; he <i>invented</i> his
own themes, thus opening the way to the idea that each text should
have a theme to suit its special character, a principle which rules
in modern music. Since the themes thus took on greater significance,
it became important that accompanying parts should not obscure them
by over-elaboration; hence the counterpoint used became clearer
and simpler, and therefore more artistic. Another fact of great
significance is that frequently the madrigals were played by viols,
instead of being sung by voices. Composers marked the pieces as “Apt
for viols or voices.” It was also customary to sing one part and play
the others on instruments, the design being to cause the melody to
stand out more clearly; this aided in developing a feeling for the
solo with instrumental accompaniment, a fact of great significance in
preparing the way for the opera.</p>
<p><b>Petrucci</b>.—Music owes a great debt to <b>Ottaviano Petrucci</b>,
who is credited with devising a method for printing music from movable
type. He was born in 1466, died in 1523 or shortly after that date.
Before he began his great work all music was written out by hand, a
fact which necessarily interfered with its circulation; the works of
the great writers were jealously guarded and students had small chance
to profit by the work of experienced composers. Petrucci and his
successors changed this. In 1501, he printed a collection of ninety-six
pieces in three and four parts by Isaac, Josquin, Hobrecht, Okeghem and
others; in 1504, a collection of eighty-three motets for four, five
and six voices. By the time the composers of the Venetian Madrigal
school appeared on the scene, printing processes had been improved and
spread more widely; thus their works could be circulated freely and
made popular. We who know the tremendous power of the printing press
can appreciate the new force in the development of music inaugurated by
Petrucci in the early part of the 16th century.

the finest madrigals by the Italian and English composers. The members

one madrigal and note its essentially melodic character. This class of
compositions will also give an idea of the character of the old Church
motet and the methods used in the masses.

<h2 class="space-below2">LESSON XV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Musical Instruments</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Classification of Instruments</b>.—The means for the production
of musical sound are few in number, and of such universality and
antiquity that we cannot say when, how, or by whom they were invented.
Modern skill has not added one new means, but has simply improved the
contrivances by which musical sound is produced. We can, however, trace
the evolution and growth of the various instruments with considerable
accuracy, and to this end it is of the utmost importance to have a
clear understanding of the principles upon which musical instruments
are constructed, in order to avoid bewilderment among the endless
variety that have been and are yet made. All instruments may be divided
into three general classes: Percussion Instruments, Wind Instruments,
Stringed Instruments.</p>
<p><b>The Percussion Instruments</b> are the instruments of rhythm. In
this class are included all instruments used for this purpose. It is
universally admitted that rhythm is the very basis of music, without
which it is vague and meaningless. Possibly the physical fact that lies
behind rhythm is the tendency of all repeated muscular action to become
regular; witness the blows of the hammer on the anvil, or the carpenter
driving in a nail. The psychologic reason is that when the will has set
a certain muscular action in motion, it leaves the carrying out of the
command to some subordinate function, so <i>long as it is continuous</i>;
but if the continuity is to be interrupted, the will must again exert
itself; hence, drumbeating and rattle shaking must of necessity be
rhythmic. Nearly all savages have dances of various kinds. Varieties
of drum rhythms arise from the almost universal custom of accompanying
dances with drums and rattles.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Varieties of Percussion Instruments</b>.—Percussion instruments
are almost endless in variety. The most primitive example is that of
a hollow log beaten with a war-club by some prehistoric savage. The
next step leads to the hollow gourd or other hollow body, across the
open end of which is stretched the dried membrane of some wild animal.
From these descend all the long line of drums of all sorts, ending
with the modern orchestral kettle-drums (tympani) which, by means
of a mechanism for changing the tension of their parchment heads,
may be tuned in various keys. Percussion instruments of metal are of
very ancient origin. In this category are included cymbals of various
sizes and shapes, gongs of all sorts, and later, bells and triangles.
Comparatively few of the percussion instruments emit sounds of any
definite pitch. They were and are to a great extent noise-producing,
used for the purpose of marking rhythms.</p>
<p><b>Wind Instruments: Vibrating Column of Air in a Tube</b>.—The next
step in advance of noise-producing instruments is the discovery of
means for the production of musical sound, which differs from noise in
the possession of <i>definite pitch</i>. This leads to a consideration of
the wind instruments that produce sound by means of a vibrating column
of air enclosed in a tube. This is an important class and has several
subdivisions, as will be seen. The simplest form of the wind instrument
is the plain tube, producing a single sound when blown across the top.
A series of such tubes fastened together side by side constitutes the
<i>Syrinx</i> or Pan’s pipe, an instrument known over all the world from
the remotest ages. This is thought to be the instrument mentioned in
Genesis with the Hebrew name <i>Ugab</i>—translated <i>organ</i>, in the verse:
“Jubal was the father of all such as handle the harp or the organ.”
It is generally believed by scholars that the <b>Pandean Pipe</b> or
<b>Syrinx</b> is the oldest of musical instruments; but long before a
sufficient advance had been made to bind together several reeds giving
different sounds, the discovery was made that sound might be produced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in this way. Some prehistoric man found it out, perhaps by blowing
across the top of a hollow bone. A whistle of this kind, of prehistoric
make, bored from one of the bones of a reindeer’s foot, was found in
a bone cave in France. It may have been used as a signal, and we may
imagine that it may have guided a troop of palæolithic hunters in the
chase of the mammoth or rhinoceros, when these animals still roamed
over the plains of Europe.</p>
<p><b>A Tube Pierced with Holes</b>.—The next advance was the discovery
that one tube could be made to give several sounds by piercing holes
in it. The effect of piercing is equivalent to shortening the tube;
thus the <b>Flute</b> came into existence. There are three forms of the
flute; the simplest is the old Japanese flute, blown at the end and
pierced with a few holes. Next, the endless variety of flutes blown at
a hole in the side, hence called the cross flute, or <i>Flauto Traverso</i>,
in German, <i>Querflöte</i>. A perfect series of these flutes may be made.
From the piece of bamboo with three or four holes, up to the exquisite
workmanship and musical possibilities of the orchestral Boehm flute,
all these flutes are identical in principle. The third kind of flute
is blown at the end and is furnished with a diaphragm, which directs
the air in a thin stream against the edge of the opening. Flutes of
this kind were once used under the names of <b>flageolet</b> and
<b>recorder</b>. Their chief interest lies in the fact that they have
served as the model for the flue pipes of the organ, from the ponderous
thirty-two foot Diapason to the half-inch extreme of the Mixture.</p>
<p><b>The Tube with a Reed</b>.—The next subdivision is: The tube in
conjunction with a tongue or slip of cane, called a reed. Reed
instruments are further divided into <i>single</i> and <i>double reed</i>
instruments. The double reed instrument is of great antiquity and
widely known. This is the instrument generally meant by the term
“flute” in the ancient Greek authors. It is known in China and Thibet,
and in its modern form as <b>Hautboy</b> (oboe), <b>English Horn</b>
or <b>Bassoon</b>, is an important member of the modern orchestra.
The beating or single reed is so-called because it is made a little
larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
than the orifice over which it is fixed, and therefore beats against
this orifice at every vibration, closing it and causing the air to
be emitted in puffs. This form of reed instrument is also widely
distributed. By the Greeks it was called the Berecynthian pipe;
in modern Egypt <i>Arghool</i>, in early England the Shawm, which is
a corruption of an older French name—<i>Chalumeau</i>. Under the name
<b>Clarinet</b> it is another important member of the orchestra. The
beating reed also furnishes the model after which the reed stops of the
organ are constructed.</p>
<p><b>The Tube with the Lips of the Player</b>.—The last subdivision
is the tube in conjunction with the lip of the performer, the lips
assuming the rôle of the reed. Countless varieties of <b>trumpets</b>
have been used from time immemorial, made at first from that natural
tube that has given them their generic name, the “horn” of the ox or
goat or antelope. The forms of the horn are endless, but from the conch
shell of the Japanese or the ram’s horn <i>Shofar</i> of the Hebrews to the
perfectly tuned and mechanically perfect instruments of our bands and
orchestras the series is complete, and the acoustic principle in all
respects identical.</p>
<p><b>Stringed Instruments Played by Plucking</b>.—The stringed
instruments are those which depend for their sound upon the vibration
of stretched strings. This class of instruments is of very ancient
origin. As in the case of the wind instruments, the discovery of
the principle of the vibration of a stretched string was probably
accidental. The twanging of a bow-string suggests a possible clue,
or the membranes of animals used for any purpose in which tension is
required. Earliest among stringed instruments are the various forms of
<b>Harp</b> or <b>Lyre</b>, in which each string gives a single sound,
and is put in motion by being <i>plucked</i> by the finger or <i>struck</i> by
a rod or flat strip of wood, ivory, etc., called a <i>plectrum</i>. In the
next class are included those instruments that are furnished with a
neck or fingerboard, with or without frets. In this class the strings
are comparatively few in number, as many sounds may be obtained from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
each string by altering its length by the pressure of the fingers on
the neck. These instruments are also played either with the fingers
or the plectrum; to this class belong the <b>Guitar</b>, <b>Lute</b>, <b>Mandolin</b>, etc.</p>
<p><b>The Lute Family</b>.—For many years, until displaced by instruments
of the violin family, the <b>Lute</b> occupied the foremost position
among instruments. It was a favorite instrument in the East, whence
it reached Spain and lower Italy. During the 14th century, it spread
over all Europe, retaining its popularity from the 15th to the 17th
centuries. In shape it was similar to the mandolin of the present
day. It had, however, a far greater number of strings. Five pairs of
these and a single melody string lay over the keyboard, while the bass
strings (finally five in number and used only as open strings) lay
at the side. More elaborate forms of the lute, owing to improvements
in the arrangement of the bass strings, were the <b>Theorbo</b> and
the <b>Archilute</b>. For the various forms of the lute the ordinary
measured notation was not used, but <i>special letters</i> or figures were
given to indicate, not the pitch of the sound, but the <i>proper fret</i> on
the fingerboard of the instrument to be used by the player. This method
of notation was called <b>Tablature</b>; it differed somewhat in the
various countries. Until displaced by the violin, the lute was in use
as an orchestral instrument. In addition, transcriptions of all sorts
of vocal and instrumental pieces were made for the lute, for home use,
much in the same manner as they are at the present day made for the pianoforte.</p>
<p><b>Stringed Instruments Played with a Bow</b>.—The next and most
important class resembles the last in being furnished with a neck or
fingerboard, but with strings put in vibration by a bow, the familiar
Violin family. A German writer on the stringed instruments played with
a bow gives the following as the successive steps in the evolution of
the violin: Rebec, Tromba Marina, Hurdy Gurdy, Fidel (Fidula), Chrotta,
Viole, and Violin. The early history of instruments is shrouded in
darkness, which existed up to the 16th century. Before that time,
although writers on music made reference to the instruments in use,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
they did not give detailed descriptions. Virdung, who published a work
in 1511; Agricola, in 1528; and Gerle, in 1546, were among the first
writers. Yet much confusion has arisen from the fact that these writers
used different terms for the same instruments, a difficulty that
confronts the student of musical history who consults German, French,
or Italian works.</p>
<p>1. The Rebec was of Oriental origin and consisted of a wooden frame,
which formed the side walls, the top and the bottom being spanned with
skin, like a drum. The instrument had only two strings, and was used
in accompanying singing. Later the number of strings was increased to
three. In the 8th or 9th century an instrument called the <i>Lyra</i> (Lyre)
was in use. Its shape shows a change toward the pear-shaped body and
narrow neck of the lute.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="377" src="images/image152.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image152.jpg">
</div>
<p>2. The Tromba Marina (Eng., literally, “Marine Trumpet”), which the
Germans call <i>Trumscheit</i>, had a long, sonorous body, over which a
strong string, like that of the ’cello D, was stretched. This string,
when sounded with the bow, gave forth a harsh, somewhat nasal tone,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
similar to that of the 8-foot wooden organ reed-pipe. But the proper
way to play it was by lightly touching the string with the finger,
as in making harmonics on the violin. This gave a series of tones,
according to the pitch of the open string, the same as the so-called
overtones. If the string were tuned to low C, the sounds were middle
C, then in succession E, G, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. This instrument was
a favorite with choirs of nuns to accompany their singing. Another name
given to this instrument from its single string is Monochord.</p>
<p>3. The Hurdy Gurdy, also called Vielle, Radleier (“wheel lyre”),
Bettlerleier (“mendicants’ lyre”), Organistrum and Chiffonie, was
a great favorite in the period from the 10th to the 12th century.
This peculiar instrument consisted of a resonant body, over which
four strings were stretched. It has analogies to bowed and keyed
instruments. Its shape was somewhat like that of the lute or the viola
d’amore or guitar. Two of the strings were tuned in unison, were
stopped by an arrangement of keys, directed by the player’s left hand
shortening the string, thus making it possible to play melodies of a
limited compass. The other two strings were usually tuned as Tonic and
Dominant, thus giving a drone like the bagpipe. The strings are set
in vibration by a wooden wheel, which, being well rosined, has the
function of a violin bow; this wheel is turned by a handle at the tail
end of the instrument, the player using his right hand for the purpose.</p>
<p>4. The Chrotta (Welsh Crwth—“crooth”) is one of the oldest of string
instruments played with a bow. The original home was possibly India,
but in its European use it was limited to England, and especially to
Wales. It was a favorite instrument of the Welsh bards. The oldest form
had three strings. In its later form it was mounted with six strings,
four stretched over the fingerboard and played with the bow, and two
lying at the side of the fingerboard, and pinched with the thumb of the left hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>5. Fidula (Fidel, Fiddle), equivalent to “viol,” is the comprehensive
term for the string instruments of the 8th to the 14th century. Its
resonant body was arched and pear-shaped. The French flattened it more
and called it Gigue, the Italians Giga, the Germans Geige, the latter
term still being used. Two varieties were in use—the small and the
large. The former had three strings tuned in fifths, the latter four to
six, usually tuned in fourths and one third. The “large” species was
made in four sizes for Discant (soprano), Alto, Tenor, and Bass. The
“large” instrument had no bridge such as the violin of today has, and
in its rounded form was difficult to play. Later it was cut out at the
sides, thus approaching the shape of our violin.</p>
<p>6. The Viol, which first appears in the 15th century, had a resonant
body which came almost to a point back of the neck, and the upper
part of the body of the instrument was smaller than the lower; the
fingerboard had frets like our guitar; the edges were higher, the <i>f</i>
holes were sickle-shaped, the top was flat, and the number of strings
was six. Viols were divided into two groups—those held with the arm
(like our violin), those played between the knees (like our ’cello).
They were named the soprano or discant viol (violetta), the alto and
tenor viols, and the bass viol (gamba). The contra-bass or double bass
has the viol form in certain respects.</p>
<p>From the viol family comes our violin through a diminution and
beautifying of the form, through lessening the number of strings and
doing away with the frets.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Organ, Organ Playing and Organ Music</span></span>.</h2>
<p>In the book of Genesis it is written: “Jubal, he was the father of all
such as handle the harp and organ.” It is not to be understood that the
word organ in this passage meant an instrument anything like that heard
in our churches at the present day. In fact, as St. Augustine tells us,
there was a time when all musical instruments were called organs.</p>
<p><b>The Germ of the Organ</b>.—The invention of the organ is veiled
in deepest darkness. Its development from its earliest forms to its
present state has occupied a period of almost two thousand years.
Doubtless, the first idea of a wind instrument was suggested by the
breeze blowing across the open ends of broken reeds, the discovery
naturally following that reeds of different lengths gave forth sounds
of varying pitch. In course of time, reeds or pipes, differing in
length, began to be joined together, conveniently arranged so as to
produce a succession of musical sounds, the players blowing them with
the mouth. These instruments were called <b>Pan’s Pipes</b>, the
<b>Syrinx</b> of the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p><b>The First Stage of Development</b>.—As the number of pipes was
increased, the moving of the head back and forth in order to blow them
became difficult. The pipes were then placed in a sort of box or wind
chest, a tube being added through which the player could blow, the
pipes not intended to sound being closed by the fingers. Furthermore,
as the pipes were increased in number and in size, it became necessary
to employ various mechanical accessories to furnish adequate wind
supply, and to open and close the pipes at will, the breath and fingers
of the player proving insufficient. A device was invented in the form
of a slide, rule or tongue of wood, which was placed beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
aperture of the pipe, and perforated so as to shut off or admit wind to
the pipe as it was drawn back or forth. The earliest form of bellows
might be suggested by the leathern bag of the bagpipe. In this the wind
pressure was unsteady and the tone necessarily disconnected.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="300" src="images/image157.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image157.jpg">
</div>
<p><b>The Hydraulic Organ</b>.—The first attempts to secure regular or
steady wind pressure were made by Ctesibus, who lived at Alexandria,
about 180 B. C. To him is ascribed the invention of the so-called
“<b>Hydraulic Organ</b>.” This term seems somewhat of a misnomer,
since the water was used merely to give the necessary pressure to
the bellows, and to regulate the wind supply. This method was never
developed, since the device did not seem applicable to instruments of
any considerable size. The trend was rather toward a wind supply from
a bellows operated on the same principle as that of the blacksmith’s.
In the Hydraulic Organ the water was thus applied: An inverted air
receiver, into which the wind was forced by a bellows, was immersed
in a tank of water, the pressure of the water around and above the
receiver forcing the air through an aperture at the top into the pipes,
the pressure being regulated by the volume of water in the tank. The
hydraulic organ continued more or less in use up to the early part of the 14th century.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Earliest Organs</b>.—The organ developed little as to size or
mechanical improvements during the first ten centuries of the Christian
Era, and it is difficult to trace the progressive stages in point of
time, place or mechanical invention. The first organ known to the
people of Western Europe was a present from the Byzantine emperor,
Constantine, to Pepin the Short, Major-Domo of the Frankish Kingdom, in
742. It had brass pipes and the “keys” were struck by hands and feet.
Eastern organs also came into France in the time of Charlemagne, son
of Pepin. The first organ used in Germany was made in 812, modelled
after the one just mentioned. In 880, the Pope ordered an organ and
an organ builder from Germany, which seems to indicate that the art
had found support there at an early date. Although not considered
absolutely indispensable, the organ from that time on seems to have
been generally adopted for use in churches. Its many imperfections gave
ground for criticism, yet today it is considered, <i>par excellence</i>, the
ecclesiastical instrument.</p>
<p><b>Increase in the Size of Organs</b>.—The organ builders of these
early days were mostly monks, Pope Sylvester II (1003) being eminent,
under the name of Gerbert, prior to his election to the papacy. They
built small organs called “<b>Portative</b>,” and large organs called
“<b>Positive</b>.” The old hydraulic organ, owing to its excessive
weight, was called “Positive” to distinguish it from the “Portative” or
portable organ, and these terms have been perpetuated to the present
time. An organ built for the Cathedral at Winchester, England, had ten
keys, four hundred pipes and twenty-six bellows, which were operated
by seventy men, “in the sweat of their brows.” Since forty pipes were
attached to a single key, it may be readily understood why its tone was
compared to thunder. The keys were very large, having a deep fall, and
required the whole force of the hand to press down a single one.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Mechanical Improvements</b>.—The pipes in the early organs were
made of copper, lead, tin, silver, glass, ivory and various woods, but
experiments finally showed <b>tin</b> or <b>wood</b> to be best suited
for the purpose. The earliest organs had about twelve pipes, and the
larger instruments three octaves, but without the chromatic intervals.
The pipes were arranged according to the sequence of tones in the old
Church modes, the <i>octave containing</i> but <i>three semitones</i>: between
E-F, A-B flat and B-C. The chromatic tones were added gradually, the
breadth of the keys being correspondingly reduced as the increased
number of keys occupied the same space as before. Heretofore, the
<i>wind</i> had usually been <i>forced from</i> the <i>bellows</i> by the
<i>weight</i> of men standing upon them, but in the 10th century use began
to be made of a <b>lever</b>, the bellows presumably being weighted.</p>
<p><b>The Keyboard is Adopted</b>.—In the 11th century, the keyboard
appeared, supplanting the levers and slides, previously in use. The
first organ containing this marked improvement was made for the
Cathedral at Magdeburg, Germany. It had sixteen keys. In 1350, a monk
at Thorn built an organ with twenty-two keys, and in 1361 an organ was
built for the Cathedral at Halberstadt with fourteen diatonic and eight
chromatic tones in a compass extending from B, second line, bass staff,
to A, second space, treble. This organ had three keyboards, now termed manuals.</p>
<p><b>The Pedals</b>.—The invention of pedals is variously ascribed
to Albert Van Os (about 1120), to Van Valbeke, of Brabant, and to
a German named <b>Bernhard</b> (1470), an organist of Venice. The
latter probably improved, but did not invent the pedals. The pedals at
first did not exceed the compass of an octave, and were used only for
sustaining prolonged tones. They were <i>fastened</i> to the broad <i>manual
keys</i> by stout cords, thus enabling the performer to draw down the
desired key with the foot. About the year 1418 the pedals began to be
attached to <i>independent pedal-pipes</i>, thus imparting to the organ
a certain dignity and sonority, still a chief characteristic of the
instrument. After 1475, all important organs were built with pedal keyboard.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Introduction of Stops</b>.—Up to the 14th century, the
different registers (set of pipes with uniform tone quality) could not
be sounded separately, that is to say: <i>all</i> the <i>pipes</i> belonging to
any one key <i>sounded</i> when that key was depressed. At the close of the
14th century it was found possible to add <b>valves</b> to the pipes
in such a manner as to cause the wind to pass through or be cut off
from any series of pipes at will. The opening and closing was managed
through a spring. The next improvement was to introduce a <b>slide</b>
to open or close the passage of wind into the pipes. With these
improvements it became possible for builders to set themselves to the
improvement of the various “stops” or registers.</p>
<p><b>Improvements in Stops</b>.—In the 15th century, pipes of sixteen
and thirty-two feet in length began to be used, necessitating a greatly
<i>enlarged bellows</i>. Pipes were <i>closed</i> at the <i>top</i>, thereby lowering
the pitch an octave. They were given <i>smaller diameters</i>, producing a
softer tone quality. The <i>shapes</i> of the pipes were <i>varied</i>, giving
additional variety in tone quality.</p>
<p>Thus began the broad classifications of “<b>Open</b>” and
“<b>Stopped</b>” pipes in all their varieties. The “<b>Reeds</b>”
(pipes containing a vibrator or tongue to set the column of air
in motion) were familiar to the earliest performers, but were not
introduced into the organ until as late as the 14th century. Further
improvements were made in the bellows at the beginning of the 16th century.</p>
<p><b>St. Mary’s, Lübeck</b>.—In 1561, a three-manual organ was in
use in St. Mary’s, Lübeck, Germany. To this organ all the important
improvements were successively added at various intervals until it
had, at the beginning of the 18th century, in the three manuals,
respectively, thirteen, fourteen and fifteen stops, and in the pedal,
fifteen stops. It was to hear the famous Buxtehude play upon this organ
that Sebastian Bach walked fifty miles in 1705.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Design of Improvements</b>.—Great improvements have been made in
organ building since the time of Bach, all designed to give the player
greater resources, and increased facility in the handling and control
of the resources, which in the present day are simply enormous.</p>
<p><b>The Organ in the American Colonies</b>.—Although the first organs
heard in America were probably introduced by the Spaniards, of these
there are no authentic records. According to reliable historic data,
the famous old “Brattle” organ was “the first organ that ever pealed
to the glory of God in this country.” It was imported from London, in
1713, by Mr. Thomas Brattle, who bequeathed it to the Brattle Street
Church, Boston, directing that the parish “procure a sober person that
can play skilfully thereon with a loud noise.” This organ became the
property of King’s Chapel, Boston, and was used until 1756.</p>
<p><b>No Art in Early Organ Playing</b>.—The organs of the early
Christian period were of such a character that playing, in the sense
in which we now understand the word, was out of the question. For
some time the span of the hand possible to players did not exceed the
distance of a fifth. If an octave was to be struck, a second player was
necessary. Only with the narrowing of the keys did artistic playing
become possible. In fact, organ playing has invariably reflected the
style and development of contemporary musical art.</p>
<p><b>Early Organists</b>.—The credit of being “father of organists” is
given to <b>Francesco Landino</b>, of Florence (1325-1390), and after
him to <b>Bernhard</b>, mentioned as the inventor of the organ pedals.
The oldest organ compositions are some works by <b>Konrad Paumann</b>
(1410-1473), who was born blind, yet, like many others since, became
a thoroughly trained musician in spite of his affliction. He also
played other instruments and was a fine contrapuntist. Another of the
early organists is <b>Benedictus Ducis</b> (or Hertoghs), born at
Bruges, about 1480. He was a pupil of Josquin des Pres. From Ducis,
representing the second Flemish school, as founded by Okeghem, there is
a chain almost of master and pupil, between the early masters of organ
playing and polyphonic writing and Bach, who in these arts became the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
master of all. Paumann’s pieces show the style of composing for the
instrument that was considered appropriate. They are essentially
transcribed, but elaborated, vocal works. The compositions of the next
organists of fame, Willaert, of Venice (1490-1562), and Cyprian di Rore
(1516-1565), pupil of the former, have distinct names. <i>Ricercari</i>,
<i>Intonationi</i>, <i>Contrapunti</i>, <i>Toccati</i>, <i>Praeambula</i>, and <i>Canzoni</i>,
but the character remains the same, vocal pieces, elaborated and
freely embellished with runs and other passage work. Later the term
<i>Ricercari</i> came to mean a sort of fantasia in fugal form, often on
a popular air; <i>Toccata</i> became a free fantasia with brilliantly
figurated passages, and a <i>Praeambulo</i> a prelude to a larger piece.
Other famous organists of this period were <b>Bernhard Schmidt</b>
(1520-?), German; <b>Claudio Merulo</b> (1532-1604), organist at
Venice, and his successors, the two <b>Gabrieli’s</b>.</p>
<p><b>Frescobaldi and His Successors</b>.—The greatest of all the
organists of the earlier days, to whom the title of “Father of true
organ playing” has been given, was <b>Girolamo Frescobaldi</b>,
born in 1583 at Ferrara, in Italy, educated in Flanders, and from
1608 to his death in 1644 organist at St. Peter’s, Rome. His fame
was so great that the spacious cathedral was often filled when he
gave an organ recital. His compositions, many of which have been
preserved, have a very decided contrapuntal character, whence some
have called him the inventor of the organ fugue. Two prominent German
organists, whose compositions were studied by Bach, were <b>Caspar
Kerl</b> (1627-1693), and <b>Jacob Froberger</b> (———1667), both of
whom lived in Vienna. The most eminent organist of the 17th century
was <b>Johann Peter Sweelinck</b> (1562-1621), pupil of Zarlino,
the famous Italian theorist, and of Andreas Gabrieli, organist of
Venice. Sweelinck occupied the position of organist at the Cathedral
in Amsterdam, and gave much attention to the development of the fugal
style of composition. His compositions are of the highest importance
historically, since they exhibit the first known examples of the
independent use of the pedals in a real fugal part. He was the most
eminent organist of his time (being called the organist maker), and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
was the teacher of the following noted players: <b>Jacob Praetorius</b>
(died at Hamburg in 1651); <b>Heinrich Scheidemann</b> (1596-1663),
also located at Hamburg; <b>Jan Adams Reinken</b> (1623-1722), from
1663 organist and successor to Scheidemann at the Catherine Church,
Hamburg (Bach came to Hamburg several times to hear Reinken play and to
learn his style); <b>Samuel Scheidt</b> (1587-1654), organist at Halle.
Some of their compositions are accessible.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><b><span class="smcap">Johann Peter Sweelinck</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p>Other famous organists of this period were <b>Johann Pachelbel</b>
(1653-1706), located at Nuremberg (Bach studied his works as a
lad); <b>Dietrich Buxtehude</b> (1637-1707), organist at Lübeck for
thirty-nine years. One of the most important names of this period
of development is that of <b>Johann Joseph Fux</b> (1660-1741). His
“<i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>,” published in 1725, a treatise on counterpoint
based on the practice of the great masters, played an important part in
the training of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p><b>English Organists</b>.—In the history of English organ playing,
the first great name to engage our attention is that of <b>Thomas
Tallys</b>, born about 1520. He is called the “Father of English
church music.” He served under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Queen Mary and
Queen Elizabeth, as organist of the Chapel Royal. English organists
of distinction contemporary with and succeeding Tallys were <b>John
Merbecke</b>, <b>Richard Farrant</b>, <b>William Byrd</b>, <b>John
Bull</b>, <b>Thomas Morley</b>, <b>Orlando Gibbons</b> (a contemporary
of Frescobaldi), <b>Matthew Lock</b>, <b>John Blow</b> and <b>Henry
Purcell</b>. The last mentioned, born in 1658, became organist of
Westminster Abbey in 1680. The name of Purcell is one of the strongest
in the history of English music. It was his ambition to found a
distinctive school of English composition. Although not successful in
this, he made a lasting impression on English church music and produced
many charming secular works. It is on record that he stood high in the
estimation of his European contemporaries.</p>
<p><b>Culmination in Bach and Handel</b>.—The Polyphonic Period
culminated in Bach and Handel, both born in 1685. These two, who
never met, and who worked upon dissimilar lines, were the most famous
organists of their day, in addition to their greatness in composition.</p>
<p><b>The Organ and Polyphonic Music</b>.—Bach must be regarded as the
source of modern organ composition and playing. In him polyphonic
composition attained its highest perfection and the organ stands as the
centre of the Polyphonic school. The development of the Opera and its
influence towards a freer style in vocal and instrumental composition
and the tendency of instrumental music to develop along harmonic lines
had the effect of relegating polyphonic music to the Church with the
organ as its chief vehicle. It is only of comparatively recent years
that the organ has become a concert instrument. Bach’s treatment of
the instrument serves as a model for the composers of all time and the
study of his works is indispensable to the development of technical
command of the organ and the cultivation of the true organ style.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Handel’s permanent contribution to organ literature consists of sets of
<b>Concertos</b>. These concertos, a number of which are still played
and admired, excited the enthusiasm of Sir John Hawkins, who gives
a glowing account of them in his history. <b>Bach</b> was appointed
Cantor at the <i>St. Thomas Schule</i>, Leipzig, in 1723, and it was here
that much of his greatest work was accomplished. In addition to his
duties at the school, he directed the music in the Churches of St.
Thomas and St. Nicholas. As to the relative superiority of Bach and
Handel as organists, contemporary opinion seems to have differed
widely. Each undoubtedly had a style of his own as shown in his
published compositions. Each excelled in improvisation.</p>
<p><b>The Chorale in Protestant Organ Music</b>.—In addition to his
incomparable preludes and fugues, toccatas, fantasias and pieces in the
larger forms, Bach made the polyphonic treatment of the <b>chorale</b>
an art peculiarly his own. In fact, the German style of organ playing
may be said to have developed from the chorale and from the music of
the Reformation. This furnished a fresher and very different source
of inspiration from the Gregorian chant which had been handled so
effectively by Frescobaldi and his Italian successors.</p>
<p><b>Marchand</b>.—One of the most renowned of early French organists
was <b>Louis Marchand</b> (1671-1732). In 1717, while living under
banishment in Dresden, he was to have entered into a trial of
skill with Bach, but lost courage and departed on the morning of
the appointed day. A certain triviality has at times characterized
the French school of organ music, undoubtedly a reflection of the
prevailing style and taste in other branches of musical composition. Of
later years, however, a more serious and exalted style has developed.</p>
<p><b>The German School</b>.—To return to the German organists. A name
familiar to all students of the organ is that of Rinck. <b>Johann C. H.
Rinck</b> (1770-1846) was a pupil of Kittel, who in turn was a pupil of
J. S. Bach. Rinck’s reputation is based largely on his “Practical Organ
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
School,” a work still in use. Another name of importance is that of
<b>Johann Gottlob Schneider</b> (1789-1864). He has had the reputation
of being one of the greatest German organists since the time of
Bach. Of the great composers since Bach, <b>Mendelssohn</b> stands
conspicuous as an organist and composer of organ music. Haydn, Mozart
and Beethoven, although occasionally using the organ in their scores,
did not compose for the instrument. Mendelssohn developed a decided
fondness for the organ, which he played admirably. His six sonatas and
three preludes and fugues are masterpieces. Among the representative
German organists and composers should be mentioned: <b>Adolph Hesse</b>
(1809-1863), author of the “Practical Organist” and a prolific
composer; <b>Karl August Haupt</b> (1810-1891), a celebrated teacher,
numbering among his many pupils from all countries such prominent
American organists as Eugene Thayer, Clarence Eddy and J. K. Paine;
<b>Carl Ludwig Thiele</b> (1816-1848) composer of some of the most
difficult known works for the organ; <b>Gustav Merkel</b> (1827-1885),
a prolific composer, whose sonatas are numbered among the standard
works for the instrument; <b>J. G. Rheinberger</b> (1837-1901), one of
the finest organists and best teachers of his time and a composer of
great ability, whose twenty sonatas form a permanent addition to the
best organ literature. A number of American organists were among his pupils.</p>
<p><b>The French School</b>.—Prominent among organists of the French
school in the 19th century may be mentioned: <b>L. J. A.
Lefébure-Wély</b> (1817-1869) and <b>Antoine Eduard Batiste</b>
(1820-1876). The works of both these organists are still widely played
and have won much popularity. Wely has been called the “Auber of the
organ.” His works display fertility of melodic invention and a piquancy
of harmonic treatment, but are entirely lacking in the polyphonic
element. Much the same may be said of Batiste, who was a fine player
and teacher, and who equalled Wely in tunefulness but not in
musicianship. <b>Nicholas Jacques Lemmens</b> (1823-81), a great player
(especially of Bach) and author of the celebrated “Ecole d’Orgue”
may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
be said to have laid the foundation of the modern French school.
Conspicuous among his successors have been: <b>Camille Saint-Saëns</b>
(1835-——), a most versatile musician and a noted organist; <b>Théodore
Dubois</b> (1837-——), <b>Théodore Salome</b> (1834-——) and <b>Felix
Alexandre Guilmant</b> (1837-——). Guilmant, one of the most noted
organists and composers of the present day, was a favorite pupil of
Lemmens. He has been one of the most prolific composers since the time
of Bach, is a master of all the resources of the modern organ, and
has a fertility of invention and a fluent command of contrapuntal
resources. Another eminent French organist is <b>C. M. Widor</b> (1845-
——), also a composer of distinction. A powerful influence was exerted
on modern organ music, as well as general composition, by the eminent
organist and composer, <b>César Franck</b>, who was, for a number of
years, in charge of the organ class at the Paris <i>Conservatoire</i>.</p>
<p><b>The Italian School</b>.—Among recent Italian organists <b>Filippo
Capocci</b> (1840-——) and <b>Enrico Bossi</b> (1861-——) are worthy
of mention. Both are splendid organists and prolific composers. They
are leaders in the revival of good organ playing in Italy, where a
determined effort is being made to restore the art to its former supremacy.</p>
<p><b>The English School</b>.—England has furnished a long line of
19th century organists of ability, prominent among whom are: <b>Sir
John Goss</b> (1800-1880), <b>Henry Smart</b> (1813-1879), <b>E. J.
Hopkins</b> (1818-1901), <b>S. S. Wesley</b> (1810-1876), <b>Dr. Wm.
Spark</b> (1825-1897). Foremost among English organists stands the
name of <b>Wm. T. Best</b> (1826-1897). He was one of the most famous
concert organists of his time, but is best known to organ students
by his “Arrangements from the Scores of the Great Masters,” in which
he demonstrated that the organ is in itself capable of reproducing
certain orchestral effects without transcending its proper functions
or descending to trickery. “The Organ,” by <b>Sir John Stainer</b>
(1840-1901), is one of the most widely used elementary works for
instruction in organ playing. Dr. Stainer was the successor of Sir John
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Goss, at St. Paul’s, London, and was appointed Professor of Music at
Oxford University in 1889. <b>Frederic Archer</b> (1838-1901) has been
considered one of the greatest of organ players. After a successful
career in England, he came to America in 1880. He did much towards
popularizing and elevating the art of organ playing in this country.
Prominent among contemporary English organists stands <b>Edwin H.
Lemare</b> (1865-——), who succeeded Frederic Archer as organist of
Carnegie Hall, Pittsburg, in 1902. He is a skilful virtuoso, a composer
of originality, and a leading representative of the modern English school.</p>
<p><b>Modern Organ Music</b>.—Organ playing and composition have kept
pace with the mechanical and artistic evolution of the instrument,
and the lines between the various schools are becoming less closely
drawn. The tendency of builders to imitate orchestral tone and effects
has had influence on composers and players alike. This tendency is
less noticeable in the works of the German school, where a modified
polyphony still flourishes, based on the principle of the classic
treatment of the chorale and growing out of the music of the Lutheran
Church. The organ compositions of the modern French school are
characterized by grace, refinement and originality, coupled with a
certain dignity and elegance. They combine free harmonic treatment and
modern polyphony, together with certain ornate characteristics, growing
out of the elaborate ceremonial music of the Latin Church, and bringing
into play all the resources of tone color and expressive treatment
of the modern instrument. Much the same may be said of the modern
English school, which nevertheless still shows traces of the early
English style, based on the dignity and purity of cathedral use and
tradition. The orchestral tendency, both in composition for the organ
and in the transcription of orchestral works for the instrument, shows
itself more or less in all schools, and the organ, in addition to its
position in the church, is becoming more and more a concert instrument.
The compositions of the American organists reflect, in a measure, the
characteristics of the schools in which they have been trained, and in
particular show traces of the styles of the masters with whom they have
chiefly studied.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a>

<h2>LESSON XVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Beginning of the Opera</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Renaissance</b>.—The Opera, in its inception, was literary
rather than musical in nature. It was a result of what is known as
the Renaissance, so-called because its most prominent manifestation
in Italy was a revival of the learning of the ancients. This phase
of the movement was initiated by <b>Petrarch</b> (1304-1370), who
devoted his life to the study of the classical past of Italy. The
Latin classics had never been entirely lost, but those of the Greeks
had become practically extinct during the dark ages which followed the
conquest of the Roman Empire by the barbarians of the North, in the 5th
century. The arts had been kept alive only through the fostering care
of the Church, and all had taken on a conventionally ecclesiastical
character. Education had declined; it was practically confined to
churchmen—even kings and rulers could barely sign their names, while
the people at large were sunk in gross ignorance. The revival of Latin
literature through the influence of Petrarch led to an interest in the
Greek classics which soon became the engrossing study of the learned.
Diligent search was made for lost and forgotten manuscripts; academies
of learning were founded; lectures were given on Greek philosophy.
In the enthusiasm thus created it was even thought that not only the
arts and literature of the ancient world might be restored, but its
governmental, social and political structure as well.</p>
<p><b>Scope of the Renaissance</b>.—The Renaissance, however, was not
merely literary in nature. It was in reality the awakening of man from
the spiritual and intellectual slumber which had bound him for nearly a
thousand years. Long before it was defined it had been perceptible in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
many ways. First, materially, in a spirit of exploration, of adventure
and enterprise. Traders and travelers startled Europe with glowing
accounts of the far East; missionaries took long and dangerous voyages
in the hope of converting its heathen inhabitants. An eager desire for
increased commercial facilities with these favored countries by means
of a westward passage brought about the discovery of America, with
which modern history may be said to have opened.</p>
<p>With this extension of the world’s boundaries, the mind of man began
to expand as well. As he looked forward with eager anticipation to the
future, he studied the past with an eye newly alive to the treasures of
its buried culture. Instead of his former acquiescence in being one of
a dull, inert mass, serving without question those in authority over
him, he began to feel and to assert his own individuality, to resist
the crushing weight of feudalism which had hitherto oppressed him.
Freedom of intellect, of conscience, of science, of art, was in the air.</p>
<p>The effect of this transition from medievalism toward modern liberty
of thought and action varied with different nationalities. In northern
nations it took the direction of rebellion against prevailing religious
and political conditions, for example, in Germany and England. Italy,
however, remained steadfast in religion and government; the revolt was
against traditions in matters of art and literature. Roman law and
Greek philosophy were exhumed; the classics were zealously studied for
standards of taste and culture.</p>
<p><b>Music of the Ancients</b>.—Notwithstanding this research, no
trace was found of the music actually in use among the ancients. From
the evanescent nature of the art and the total lack of examples, the
elaborate descriptions of its complicated system of scales and modes
given by Greek philosophers failed to yield a trustworthy clue to its real character.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>It was known, however, that the <i>drama</i>, owing to the enormous
proportions of the amphitheatre in which it was performed, was
<i>musically declaimed</i>, and that the voices of the actors and chorus
were sustained by lyres and flutes. Thus, in the Greek tragedy we find
the principal features of the modern opera—scenery, dramatic action,
solo and choral singing, the orchestra. It was also known that in the
music of the Greeks the <i>word</i> was the <i>governing principle</i>; that
there was no independent instrumental music—nor was there elsewhere
for many centuries afterward. The tone was regarded only as a means of
heightening the effect of the poetry; the succession of long and short
syllables dictated both rhythm and melody. Of harmony in the modern
sense of the term, there was none; instruments and voices alike were in unison.</p>
<p><b>Music Chiefly Choral</b>.—In the 16th century, Florence was the
centre of the enthusiasm for Greek culture. She and her sister-cities
in the north of Italy were the arbiters in matters of taste, of
learning and erudition. There, toward the end of the century, a small
group of scholars and musicians, known as the <i>Camerata</i> (Chamber),
meeting at the house of Count Bardi, discussed the possibility of
reproducing the musical declamation of Greek tragedy. The time was
ripe for such an experiment. The polyphonic school had reached its
climax in the intricate works of <b>di Lasso</b> (1520-1594) and
<b>Palestrina</b> (1514-1594). Though admirably suited to the Church,
the contrapuntal style of these great composers was manifestly unfit
for dramatic purposes; it could voice the aspirations of a body of
worshipers swayed by a common belief, but could not express individual
feeling. No voice was more important than another, all progressed
according to canonic law, their complex intertwining practically
destroying the essentially secular elements of accent and rhythm. It
was, in short, the embodiment in music of the medievalism which had so
long controlled Church and State.</p>
<p>Thus far the spirit of emancipation which had produced such great
results in the other arts and in politics elsewhere had touched
music but lightly. Attempts had been made to break the restraints of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
contrapuntalism, but there was a total ignorance as to what steps
would prove most effective in reaching that end, and nothing definite
had been accomplished. Aside from the Folk-song, which was ignored
by musicians save only as it served as Cantus Firmus for their
counterpoint, there was no music for the solo voice; it was conceived
solely from a choral standpoint.</p>
<p><b>The Recitative</b>.—Their dissatisfaction with the school of music
then in vogue and the impossibility of adapting it to their purpose
led to various experiments by this band of enthusiasts to discover the
principles upon which the Greeks had founded the musical declamation
employed in their tragedies. They argued that it must have followed
as closely as possible the <i>inflections of the voice</i> in speaking;
therefore they made this their study. Thus originated the Recitative,
the distinguishing feature of the lyric drama, which, though using the
definite pitches of the musical scale, reproduces in its progressions
and cadences the characteristic but intensified effect of an oratorical
delivery of the text. It was the exact contrary of the music of the
age in which the word counted for almost nothing, the art of combining
independent voices and of playing them off one against the other for everything.</p>
<p><b>The Cantata</b>.—The first result of their efforts was the Cantata
(from <i>cantare</i>, to sing), meaning a composition for the voice in
contradistinction to the Sonata (from <i>sonare</i>, to sound), which
was applied to one for instruments. The Cantata had but little in
common with what is now understood by the term. It was a recitation
on musical intervals for a single voice accompanied by but one
instrument. Anything like a formal melody was carefully avoided, and
the accompaniment, generally played on the lute, was of the most
unpretending character. The first of these cantatas was composed by
<b>Vincenzo Galilei</b>, the father of the celebrated astronomer, on
the tragic fate of Count Ugolino, as related by Dante in the <i>Inferno</i>.
This, therefore, was the <i>first art-song</i> ever composed. Unfortunately,
it has been lost; but contemporary accounts tell of the profound
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
impression it created. Other cantatas were written and sung by
<b>Giulio Caccini</b> (1550-1618), a skilled and an admirable lutist as
well, and all awakened the utmost enthusiasm among the little company.</p>
<p>These works were known as <i>Nuove Musiche</i> (new music) and such as have
survived are, in general, painfully thin and crude to modern ears. When
compared with the rich polyphony of the prevailing Church style they
seem at the first blush to indicate retrogression. Progress, however,
seldom advances in a direct line; it generally moves by spirals which
at times apparently retreat only to mount the higher at the succeeding
curve. These dull recitatives bore the <i>germ of emancipation</i> from the
scholastic laws which had heretofore prevented music from expressing
individual emotion; they typify the spirit of the Renaissance and are
the foundation of the art as we now know it.</p>
<p><b>The First Opera</b>.—Another of the number, <b>Jacopo Peri</b>
(1561-1633), also a musician, took the next step by composing music
of the same style to a drama, the <i>Dafne</i> (Daphne) of the poet
Rinuccini, who was the life and soul of this attempt to revive the
lost declamation of the Greeks. This was performed privately in 1595
at the Corsi Palace, and produced so strong an impression that it was
repeated a number of times at the Carnival seasons of the succeeding
years. In 1600, Peri was invited to compose a similar work for the
marriage festivities of Henry IV of France and Maria di Medici. This
was <i>Euridice</i>, also written by Rinuccini, which bears the distinction
of being the <i>first opera</i> to receive public performance, and thus
introducing the new art-form to the world at large. The score of
<i>Dafne</i> has been lost, but that of <i>Euridice</i> still exists.</p>
<p class="space-below2">It was then known as a music drama (<i>melo
dramma</i> or <i>dramma per la musica</i>); the term opera (abbreviation for
<i>opera in musica</i>, that is, musical work) did not come into use until
the middle of the century. The orchestra, which was played behind
the scenes, consisted of a harpsichord, two lutes and a bass-viol.
In addition, three lutes played a short <i>ritornello</i> (interlude)
in one scene. With this exception, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> instruments were used
merely to support the voice; the tonality was almost exclusively minor,
and the harmony of the simplest. It is thought that Peri sang the part
of Orpheus and that Francesca Caccini, daughter of the composer and one
of the most gifted singers of the day, sang Euridice.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="272" src="images/image176.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_image176.jpg">
<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">Part of an Air by Caccini</span>.</p>
<p class="center space-below1"><a href="music/music176.mid" id="id-550055625417320190">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Caccini claimed the new style as his invention, and it is certain that
parts of <i>Euridice</i> were composed by him, though Peri’s name alone
appears on the title page of the published work. Emulating the success
of his colleague, the former soon set the same drama to music.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Early Opera</b>.—The two settings are so
similar that one might almost be taken for the other. Both display
the same characteristics. Of dramatic feeling or characterization
as understood at the present day there is no sign; development of
musical thought, none whatever; a dreary waste of recitatives is but
slightly relieved by the occasional flourishes (<i>giri e gruppi</i>,
that is, runs and turns) allowed the singers by the taste of the times.
The choruses, however, which are introduced freely, serve to vary the
monotony somewhat. They exhibit a singular mingling of the old and new
styles, natural under the circumstances. The voices sing either in a
recitative-like unison, or begin in fugato, and later move in simple
harmonic progression. Their distaste for the contrapuntal style led
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
these reformers to reject it so far as they could. Its appearance at
all is due to the fact that no other mode of writing for a number of
voices had as yet been devised—a strictly harmonic treatment had not
been thought of. Since, then, they were at a loss as to the management
of choral masses, they were obliged to have recourse in part to old methods.</p>
<p>Another name associated with the Florentine school deserving mention
is that of <b>Marco da Gagliano</b>, a priest who soon took the lead
in the new movement. His first opera was <i>Dafne</i> (1607), composed
to Rinuccini’s drama which had already served Peri; it was a common
practice in those days for composers to use the same text. As a scholar
and musician, Gagliano was superior to his predecessors. He shows a
greater warmth of feeling and a tendency toward melody which they
considered as a lowering of their ideals.</p>
<p><b>The Florentine School</b>.—One particular characteristic of the
Florentine school was a sedulous <i>avoidance</i> of anything like <i>extended
melody</i> or definite form. To the composers of this school, music was
not an end in itself; it was subordinate to the distinct, <i>impassioned
declamation</i> of the poet’s verses. They held that any independent
development of musical thought was a weakness; that it tended to
distract the attention of the hearer from the drama, and to interfere
with its logical continuity. The predominant influence was that of
the scholar, not of the musician. This was to be expected from the
character of the little coterie interested in the new art-form. The
majority were wealthy amateurs, zealous students of the classics and
aflame with the desire for the actual revival of the Greek tragedy.
Peri and Caccini were the only musicians and they were strongly averse
to the contrapuntal music of the day. Its persistently ecclesiastical
effect debarred it from expressing the personal feeling which was
the object of their research. In the effort to escape its ban, they
unwittingly emancipated their art from the control of the Church, and
made it accessible to mankind in general. This, therefore, is the great
service of the Florentine reformers: the establishment of a purely
secular school of music susceptible of indefinite development.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>Making allowance for the vast difference in means due to the practical
creation of independent instrumental music since the 17th century,
their practice was precisely the same as that of the modern composer
who writes a music drama and uses the same term to define his work.
When <i>Dafne</i> and <i>Euridice</i> first saw the light, however, there was
neither knowledge nor experience to point the way; it was found only
after a slow and laborious process of experimentation, involving the
acceptance of much that was rejected after having served its turn.
Though Peri and Caccini with their confrères did not succeed in the end
they had in view, they accomplished far more by originating the Opera,
the point of departure for the whole modern art of music.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Oratorio. Development of the Opera</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The First Oratorio</b>.—The novelty of the new style, which was
called the <i>stilo rappresentativo</i> (representative style), the vigor
and freedom it gave to an impressive delivery of the text, aroused
universal attention. Among the composers who essayed it was <b>Emilio
del Cavaliere</b> (1550-1599). By applying it to a sacred subject, he
originated the Oratorio. Roman by birth, he had passed part of his life
in Florence, and though not a member of the <i>Camerata</i>, was familiar
with its aims and practice.</p>
<p>The germ both of the Opera and Oratorio is to be found in the Miracle
Plays or so-called Mysteries of the Middle Ages. These were dramatic
representations of <i>Bible scenes</i> or <i>religious allegories</i> by means
of which a populace unable to read was taught the great truths of
sacred history. Cavaliere’s oratorio, <i>La Rappresentazione di Anima e
di Corpo</i> (The Representation of Soul and Body), was given in 1600 in
Rome, at the Oratory of the Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella—hence its name.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Its Characteristics</b>.—Save for the <i>nature</i> of the <i>subject</i>,
there was no apparent difference between it and an opera. The
allegorical characters taking part appeared in costume and in action.
The score even gives directions by which it may be concluded with a
dance if so desired. By this, however, dignified and stately movements
are understood, in nowise resembling the rapid dance of modern times.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
The composer in his instructions for performance, which are unusually
full and complete, lays great stress upon an expressive delivery of the
text, and the swelling and diminishing of the tones by the singers.
In vigor and characterization it far surpasses Peri’s and Caccini’s
operas. Cavaliere’s death, which occurred ten months before the
production of his work, and the great popularity of the Opera, put a
stop to the immediate development of the Oratorio; that was reserved
for Carissimi a generation later.</p>
<p><b>Monteverde</b>.—The task of taking the opera from the experimental
stage and of placing it on the artistic foundation which it now
occupies was accomplished by <b>Claudio Monteverde</b> (1568-1643), a
man of extraordinary genius and originality. A harmonist of surpassing
force and boldness, he had always rebelled against the restraints
of the contrapuntal school, though, unlike Peri and Caccini, he
was skilled in its intricacies. He was viol player in the band of
the Duke of Mantua, and had composed masses and madrigals, many of
which were severely criticised by the pedants of the day. He joined
definite issue with them in his <i>freedom of treating dissonances</i>,
the distinguishing feature of modern harmony. Heretofore, sevenths,
ninths, augmented fourths and the like had never been heard without
preparation. Monteverde, however, introduced them without regard to
this restriction, little heeding the anathemas heaped upon his head by
those who considered his infractions of established rules unpardonable.
His ardent, restless temperament, seeking novel modes of expression,
often led to wild and extravagant combinations which even today appear
harsh and forced. At that time they must have seemed wilful attempts
at outraging the ear and the sense of harmonic propriety. These
innovations, however, are the cornerstone of modern harmony; of this as
well as of the opera, Monteverde is the real founder. What are defects
in his church music are excellences in his operas. The discords which
disturb the serenity of a religious atmosphere are admirably fitted to
produce dramatic effects and powerful climaxes. Monteverde belonged to
the stage as his great contemporary, Palestrina, belonged to the church.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Position of Music in the 17th Century</b>.—The interest which the
success of the Florentine composers would have for a man thus gifted
can be readily imagined. Yet he was obliged to wait a number of years
for an opportunity to emulate their achievements. Music then was the
especial pastime of the great; it was part of the state with which they
surrounded themselves. Almost all titled and wealthy families had their
own bands of musicians and choirs of singers. These assisted in their
private chapels and lent additional eclat to seasons of festivity.
Concerts and operas were given only at court or in the palaces of
noblemen; public halls for any kind of musical occasion were unknown.
A musician or composer could make his way only by attaching himself
to a noble house or by securing a patron in court circles. <i>Dafne</i>
and <i>Euridice</i> were made possible through the interest and protection
of Count Bardi and Count Corsi. The opera was also attended with
great expense. The taste of the times demanded an enormous outlay for
mounting—costumes, scenery, decorations; only the extremely wealthy
could afford it, and they reserved it for occasions of especial importance.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Monteverde’s First Opera</b>.—In 1607, the marriage of Margaret of
Savoy to Francesco Gonzaga, son of the Duke of Mantua, opened the way
for Monteverde’s first opera, <i>Arianna</i> (Ariadne), which was received
with the utmost enthusiasm. Unfortunately, but a fragment of it
remains, Ariadne’s lament after her desertion by Theseus, the most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
celebrated opera air ever written. In its unprepared discords of the
harshest nature, in the poignant expression of grief and despair so at
variance with the placid art of the day, this shows how, by a single
stroke, Monteverde cut loose from all the traditions of the past. In
its less than a score of measures it also anticipates principles of
artistic structure which were not formulated for nearly a century later
and which hold good to the present day. It is said that it brought
tears to every eye.</p>

</div>
<p><b>His Second Opera</b>.—The following year he produced his second
opera, <i>Orfeo</i> (Orpheus), so called to distinguish it from Peri’s
<i>Euridice</i> on the same subject. Though most of Monteverde’s works
have been lost, the score of <i>Orfeo</i> has been preserved. It shows
a surprising advance over the simplicity of the Florentine operas.
First of all, in the great <i>expansion of the orchestra</i>. This numbers
thirty-seven instruments which throughout are <i>combined in groups</i> and
as a whole with an art prefiguring certain effects of orchestration
supposed to be purely modern. Like harmony, instrumentation dates
from Monteverde. Instead of the customary vocal prologue, it begins
with a <i>Toccata</i> (instrumental prelude). The composer’s keen dramatic
instinct is shown by the masterly way in which he avoids the monotony
of his predecessors; the recitatives are varied by the introduction of
<i>ritornelli</i>, and each act ends with a chorus and a stately passage for
the orchestra. Five years later, the most famous composer of the day,
he left Mantua for Venice, where until his death he was director of music at St. Mark’s.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Monteverde’s Characteristics</b>.—Monteverde’s greatest service
to the opera lay in enlarging the sphere of the orchestra, and in the
initiation of a thoroughly instrumental style adapted to the character
of each instrument. He increased the number of players and released
the orchestra from the subordinate position of being a mere support
for the voice by employing it to heighten the dramatic situation. He
originated many previously unknown effects, among them the <i>pizzicato</i>
and the <i>tremolo</i> of the violins in precisely the same form as used at
present. The latter so astounded the players that at first they refused
to attempt it, saying that it was impossible. He endowed the Recitative
with far greater freedom and depth of expression; under his hand it
lost much of the dryness of the Florentine school. His manner of
<i>writing</i> for the voice was <i>declamatory</i> rather than melodious; what
traces of definite melody occur in his works are generally confined
to the instruments, in which he curiously anticipates the practice of
latter-day dramatic composers.</p>
<p><b>Popularization of the Opera</b>.—Until 1637 the opera was
restricted to royalty and the nobility. In that year the first public
opera house was opened in Venice, and such was the popularity of
the new amusement that before the end of the century there were no
fewer than eleven in that city alone, then with a population of about
140,000. It spread through Italy with almost like rapidity, bearing in
its wake an unparalleled development of the art of song.</p>
<p><b>Change of Character</b>.—With its introduction to the people,
it was manifestly impossible for the opera to retain its original
character. So long as it was confined to the cultivated, the classical
ideals of its founders met with intelligent appreciation, but when
confronted with audiences drawn from the masses desirous only of being
amused, a change was inevitable. Mythological and classical subjects
were gradually discarded in favor of those involving intrigue and
disguise; comic personages were introduced to enliven the scene. As
the dramatic action was thus brought nearer the comprehension of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
unlearned, so the music departed from the oratorical standards of
the early school, and showed a frank <i>tendency toward melody</i> and
<i>regularity of form</i>. What was lost in elevation of theme, however,
was made up by the human interest imparted to the play and the
consequent endeavor of the composer to express, by his music, the
varying vicissitudes of life. Thus it gained in warmth of feeling and
flexibility in means of expression, while the evolution of rhythmic
melody and definite musical structure laid the foundation of the art as
we now have it.</p>
<p><b>The Venetian School</b>.—Venice naturally became the centre of an
important development of the opera. Of the numerous composers forming
the Venetian school, <b>Francesco Cavalli</b> (1600-1676) and <b>Marco
Cesti</b> (1620-1669) are second only in importance to Monteverde. The
first was Monteverde’s pupil, and had much of his broad dramatic style
modified by the influences of which we have just spoken. Cesti came
to Venice from Rome, where he had been the pupil of Carissimi, and
brought with him the smoothness and melodic flow of his master, albeit
lacking in essential power. Other names of a later date are <b>Giovanni
Legrenzi</b> (1625-1690), especially noted for spirit and vivacity,
and <b>Antonio Lotti</b> (1667-1740), his pupil, known by one or two
charming airs which still survive.</p>
<p><b>Carissimi and the Oratorio</b>.—<b>Giovanni Carissimi</b>
(1604-1674), though he never wrote for the stage, was the strongest
musical influence of his day. He was an ardent admirer of the new
school, and adapted it in the form of oratorios and cantatas to the
Church. In such works the necessity for form as regards definite
tonality, distinct rhythm and melodic sequence is naturally much
greater than in the Opera where music is used to illustrate the
dramatic situation, and is furthermore elucidated by the action of the
play. When the ear alone is obliged to pass judgment there must be
evidence of design in these particulars, else the effect is confused
and bewildering. Carissimi’s musical instinct grasped this truth. His
oratorios and cantatas show a logical arrangement of choruses and
ensembles, recitatives and arias combined with a unity of effect and a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
clearness of characterization heretofore unknown. The choruses in
particular are strongly rhythmic and far more dramatic than those which
were commonly heard on the stage.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Secularization of Church Music</b>.—This introduction of the new
style into the Church marked the passing of the old school and strongly
affected methods of dramatic composition. The public had never been
in sympathy with the austere standards of the Florentine school and
welcomed the appearance of <i>intelligible melody</i> and the <i>spirited
rhythms</i> to which Carissimi gave the first direct impulse. Not only
this; he fixed the form that the music of the Church was to bear for
a century to come. This secularization of church music had its good
and bad sides; good by reason of the greater freedom and variety
of expression thus gained; bad because of the bold and mechanical
imitation of Carissimi’s purely formal details by his successors, which
in the end led to a tiresome monotony of style.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Venetian School</b>.—Thus was taken the
first step toward the complete reversal of the conditions under which
the early Opera had arisen. Instead of the music’s being subordinate
to the drama, the drama was soon to serve merely as an excuse for the
music; the opera was destined to sink to the level of a concert sung
in costume; the dramatic action reduced to a minimum. The Venetian
school marks the turning-point in this direction. The high ideals
of Monteverde and his predecessors were gradually thrust into the
background; the singer began to assume precedence over the actor; truth
of <i>expression yielded</i> to the fascinations of <i>time</i> and <i>tune</i>,
which even the musically uncultivated could enjoy without bothering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
their heads as to real dramatic fitness. Closely connected with these
tendencies was the establishment of a school of singing which, if we
may believe contemporary accounts, surpassed in technical facility and
brilliancy any vocal art heard either before or since that time. The
result was that singers finally regarded the opera only as a field for
the display of their dazzling accomplishments and in this they were
willingly supported by a public eager to be entertained and amused.</p>

<h2>LESSON XIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Alessandro Scarlatti and the Neapolitan School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Neapolitan School</b>.—What in the Venetian school had been
a <i>reaction</i> in favor of <i>form</i> and <i>melody</i> became the established
practice of the Neapolitan school. Political disturbances had hindered
the spread of the Opera in southern Italy, particularly in Naples,
but at the end of the 17th century it assumed the position formerly
occupied by Florence and Venice. Before this, however, a strong
influence had been exerted by certain composers in Rome, of whom
Carissimi was first in importance. Had it not been for the disapproval
of the Church, a definite Roman school might have arisen. Such a
school would doubtless have been advantageous to the artistic growth
of the Opera, since the public taste at Rome in matters of art was
more serious in nature than at Naples. In 1697, public performances
of opera were forbidden by the ecclesiastical authorities, and thus
the seat of further development was transferred to Naples through the
removal thither from Rome of <b>Alessandro Scarlatti</b> (1659-1725),
the founder of the Neapolitan school. As a lad, he had been a pupil of
Carissimi and also probably of Legrenzi, whose influence is clearly
seen in his early works.</p>
<p><b>Alessandro Scarlatti</b>.—Scarlatti invested his operas with a
melodic charm and a symmetrical form which thus far had appeared only
sporadically. Fascinated by the freedom of the new style, the early
composers had neglected the severe study which had been indispensable
to mastery in the Contrapuntal School, and had in the main relied on
natural gifts. Following the ideal of Peri and his associates, their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
operas were largely a succession of recitatives which in the end grew
monotonous and wearisome; of form, of structure, of purely musical
effect they bore but slight traces. Scarlatti saw that the time had
come for a change in style—one that should combine the musical
interest of the old with the dramatic spirit of the new. The foremost
musician of his time, he perceived the weakness of the exclusively
declamatory opera—its lack of variety and want of appeal to the public in general.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="504" src="images/image188.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image188.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below1"><b><span class="smcap">Alessandro Scarlatti</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>His Characteristics</b>.—He was not a reformer. He lacked the
strong and rugged dramatic fibre of his predecessor, Monteverde.
Scholarship; an inexhaustible fund of melody, pure, polished,
refined; a gift of characterization—general, not particular, and
always subordinate to a keen sense of beauty—are his distinguishing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
characteristics. He fell in with the taste of the day and devoted his
gifts to the production of works which should satisfy the musician and
please the public. The solidity of his early schooling had made him
a master of counterpoint, and this he applied in the construction of
logically worked-out accompaniments, fuller, richer and more expressive
than had been attempted by his less learned contemporaries. In nobility
of conception and skill in solving contrapuntal problems he often
shows that he is not unworthy the name of the “Italian Bach,” as he
is sometimes called. Like Bach, also, he was one of the most prolific
composers of all times. He left one hundred and fifteen operas,
sixty-six of which are still extant, more than two hundred masses,
besides many miscellaneous works for church and concert, both vocal
and instrumental.</p>
<p><b>His Services to the Opera</b>.—To the simple recitative (recitativo
secco), invented by Peri, he added the important form known as the
<i>recitativo stromentato</i> (accompanied recitative). This was not
strictly original with Scarlatti, since it had been introduced by
Purcell in his <i>Dido and Eneas</i> ten years before the Italian had
first used it in his opera <i>Rosaura</i> (1690). There is no probability,
however, that Scarlatti was acquainted with the Englishman’s works; it
is a not uncommon matter for two minds to arrive independently at the
same result. In the accompanied recitative, the voice, instead of being
supported by detached (<i>secco</i>) chords on the harpsichord, sometimes
with the addition of a single stringed instrument, as in the simple
recitative, was accompanied by the entire orchestra, which had grown to
proportions undreamed-of in Peri’s day. Vastly developed by the growth
of orchestral resources, it is the distinguishing feature of the modern
music drama. As a rule, however, it was but little used in Scarlatti’s
operas or in those of his contemporaries. Interest in the drama, as
such, was fast sinking to a negligible quantity; audiences assembled to
hear their favorite singers, not to follow the course of a more or less
involved dramatic action. The simple recitative was, therefore, more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
frequently employed in order to hurry through the necessary details of
the play and reach the moment when the singer could delight by his art
in the aria.</p>

<p class="center space-below1"><a href="music/music190.mid" id="id-7640296975219255064">[Listen.]</a></p>
</div>
<p><b>The Aria</b>.—Scarlatti was not the inventor of the aria or air for
the single voice in the meaning of the term as applied to a certain
fixed form. Other composers had used it before him in its essential
principles, but he was the <i>first</i> to <i>formulate</i> it into a persistent
<i>type</i>, which it retained for nearly a century, despite its undramatic
character. The Scarlatti aria consisted of three parts: two contrasting
sections, concluding with a Da Capo or repetition of the first,
expressed by the formula A B A. The principle of Repetition as an
element of form is now a commonplace, but at the time it was a novelty,
and the emphasis given to it by the aria fascinated the public and made
it the principal feature of the opera. More than anything else, it led
to its degeneration. Singers found in the aria a means of displaying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
their technical skill; it became the canvas on which they embroidered
the most astonishing <i>tours de force</i>. The art of acting almost
disappeared from the operatic stage; the poise of body and voice
required for such vocal efforts banished all but a few conventional gestures.</p>
<p><b>The Overture</b>.—Scarlatti’s powers were by no means confined to
writing for the voice; the instrumental portions of his works give
evidence of equal mastery, though the popular taste for singing allowed
him but little scope for extension in this direction. His overtures in
particular show a great advance over the simple preludes of the early
Italian operas. He perfected what is known as the Italian Overture in
contradistinction to the earlier form invented by Lully, and called
the French Overture. It consisted of three movements, the first and
last quick, the middle movement slow. In its arrangement, this was the
direct precursor of the modern symphony. At first the two terms were
interchangeable; an overture when played before an opera was called
a <i>Sinfonia</i>, and curiously enough, when played independently as a
concert number it was frequently called an overture. Some of the early
symphonies were even printed with one title outside and the other inside.</p>
<p><b>The Typical Italian Opera</b>.—Thus at the beginning of the 18th
century we find the Opera on an overwhelmingly musical basis instead
of the oratorical foundation which it had in its inception. Scarlatti
fixed its form for a century. He left it consisting principally of
recitatives and arias, each opera containing from fifty to sixty of the
latter. Aside from these there was but little formal music—only an
occasional march or dance besides the overture. The simple recitative
was used for ordinary dialogue; hence it was peculiarly applicable
to the <i>Opera Buffa</i> (comic opera). The accompanied recitative was
reserved for situations of dramatic importance, and the aria served
to express individual emotion. The chorus was employed but sparingly,
generally appearing only at the end of the act to give greater eclat to
the finale. The dance, which in the early Opera had played a part of
some importance, was finally banished entirely from the scene, though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
not from the stage. It was given between the acts as an intermezzo
(interlude), and thus developed into the formal ballet. Spectacular
features, too, assumed great prominence.</p>
<p><b>The Intermezzo</b>.—The Intermezzo has a close connection with the
opera. It arose from the custom of introducing something <i>between the
acts</i> of a play or opera to entertain the audience during the necessary
period of waiting. At first, songs or madrigals were sung, then by
degrees the entertainment took on a dramatic form, until at last a
drama was given totally independent of the principal play. Singularly
enough, the acts of the two plays were performed alternately, neither
having any connection with the other. The Intermezzo was always of a
gayer, lighter character; thus when the incongruity of the practice
became apparent, it naturally evolved into the <i>Opera Buffa</i>. This was
brought about by the success of the most celebrated comic opera ever
written, <i>La Serva Padrona</i> (The Maid as Mistress), by <b>Giovanni
Pergolesi</b> (1710-1736). This was originally produced (1734) as
an Intermezzo between the acts of another play, and afterward made
a triumphant progress through all the opera houses in Europe as an
independent work.</p>
<p><b>The Opera Buffa</b>.—Though for the sake of contrast, comic
characters had been introduced into the opera during the early Venetian
period, the <i>Opera Buffa</i> did not reach its full development until the
following century. Owing to the absence of certain conventions which
had grown around the <i>Opera Seria</i> (serious opera) it became a more
characteristic mode of expression than the latter. Its melodies were
fresher, its dramatic action was less restrained and truer to life,
while it performed a valuable service by doing away with the strange
mingling of comic and serious styles which had previously disfigured
many otherwise impressive works. To it we owe the concerted Finale
which is such a feature of modern grand opera. It is attributed to
<b>Niccolo Logroscino</b> (1700-1763), who instead of the customary
conclusion of an act by a simple duet, trio, or quartet, brought all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i> on the stage to take part in a characteristic
ensemble. Greatly developed by later composers, such finales were for a
long time confined to <i>Opera Buffa</i>, until Paisiello finally introduced
them into serious opera.</p>
<p><b>Prominent Composers of the Neapolitan School</b>.—It is hardly
possible to mention more than a few of the numerous composers belonging
to the Neapolitan school. Besides Pergolesi, the most important works
of this school were composed by <b>Niccolo Porpora</b> (1685-1767),
<b>Niccolo Jommelli</b> (1714-1774), <b>Niccolo Piccini</b> (1728-1800),
<b>Giovanni Paisiello</b> (1741-1816) and <b>Domenico Cimarosa</b>
(1749-1801). Most of these were equally at home in the <i>Opera Seria</i>
and the <i>Opera Buffa</i>, but their works in the latter style have proved
the more enduring.</p>
<p>Porpora is more noteworthy for the singers he formed than for his
forty-six operas, all of which have sunk into oblivion. He was the
greatest of the many masters of singing who through their pupils
made the Opera of the 18th century the field of display for the most
remarkable singers the world has ever heard. Jommelli was one of the
most gifted composers of his day. He spent fifteen years in Germany
as capellmeister to the Duke of Wurtemburg, but the influence of this
long residence in a country where musical ideals were of a more austere
type than in Italy, though it added dignity and solidity to his art,
was fatal to his popularity when he returned to his native land; his
countrymen found his operas heavy in style and deficient in melody.
Piccini was the composer of the most popular <i>Opera Buffa</i> of the
century, <i>Cecchina</i>, but is now remembered principally by the bitter
feud which arose in Paris in 1787 between his admirers and those of
Gluck. Paisiello’s most celebrated work was <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>
(The Barber of Seville), which held the stage for thirty years until
the success of Rossini’s masterpiece on the same subject forced it into
retirement. Cimarosa’s <i>Il Matrimonio Segreto</i> (The Secret Marriage)
was an equal favorite; one of its numbers, the trio for women’s voices,
<i>Ti Faccio un Inchino</i> (I make thee a reverence), sometimes appears on modern programs.

<p><b>Influence of the Neapolitan School</b>.—Notwithstanding the
formalism of the Neapolitan school, which led to a regrettable neglect
of the dramatic signification of the Opera by an over-emphasis of its
musical element, it was of no small importance in the development of
music in general. By fixing the principles of form and melody at a time
when both were vague and undetermined, Scarlatti laid the foundation
of the great classical period, beginning with Haydn and Mozart and
ending with Beethoven. This was his contribution to absolute music,
which cannot exist without form, though its influence was disastrous
to purity of form in the branch of the art which he particularly cultivated.</p>

<h2>LESSON XX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Singing and Singers</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Early Methods of Singing</b>.—As has been noted by the reader,
music, up to this time, developed principally along vocal lines. We
have no details as to the character of the training of singers among
the Chaldeans, Egyptians and Greeks except such as indicate that their
idea of singing was a sort of musical declamation. Such seems also to
have been the idea of the nations in the north of Europe.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Welsh bards were required to undergo a very
thorough and exacting course of study, but the practical side of
singing and the rules laid down for the training of the young minstrels
is not a part of our knowledge. The songs of the early Church, sung by
masses of worshipers, were of necessity simple in every way, requiring
no art. It was not until the use of Discant became popular, and the
Polyphonic school began to use florid writing that we can infer that
there must have been some methods of training vocalists for artistic
work. Although we have little or no details as to the course of
training which the early singers received, we are justified in assuming
that they must have possessed skill in execution of no mean order. It
must not be forgotten that practically all the composers of the early
Polyphonic school were singers, able to execute their own works. Hence,
studies in singing must have gone hand in hand with composition. The
voice parts of the masses, motets and madrigals of the composers of the
13th to the 16th centuries have absolute independence of progression,
syncopations, embellishments, etc., to such an extent that it taxes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the musicianship of the chorus singer of the present day to sing them;
they are not only exacting in intonation, rhythm and other musical
matters but also in mechanical points, such as flexibility and freedom
of voice and thorough breath control.</p>
<p><b>Influence of the Opera on Singing</b>.—When the Opera was
established, after the declamatory style offered by the first composers
had proven unsuccessful in holding the public, the florid style of
the old discanters was revived and modified, which, as the Opera
developed, gave a great impetus to a systematic and thorough study of
singing. The new style of melody introduced by the opera composers of
the 17th century demanded purity of voice, wide range, flexibility,
expressive shading and a marvelous breath control, as well as great
physical endurance. Singers were expected to execute the most intricate
passages, abounding in diatonic and chromatic scales, arpeggios, turns,
gruppettos, trills, etc., of the most elaborate nature, passages
such as are considered purely instrumental today. <b>Alessandro
Scarlatti</b>, the composer, and himself a singer, is credited with
having had much to do with the great development in the art of singing.
He trained a number of singers and pupils, and thus founded the “old
Italian” school of singing. It was natural that the art side of singing
should thus develop in Italy for several reasons, notably, because
Italy had a great number of highly-trained composers, the character
of the language is such as to lend itself to the requirements of
artistic singing, broad full vowels, soft consonants, absence of final
consonants, etc., and the enthusiastic, essentially lyric temperament
of the race.</p>
<p><b>The Training of a 17th Century Singer</b>.—We are given an idea
of the course of training which singers of the 17th century were
obliged to observe in a work <i>Historia Musica</i>, published by G. A. A.
Buontempi, in 1695. This contains an account of the regulations of a
school for singers in Rome, directed by Virgilio Mazzocchi, in which
Buontempi was a pupil: The pupils were obliged to devote one hour each
day to the singing of difficult passages with the idea of acquiring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
experience; one hour to the practice of the trill, one to passages
in agility, one to literary studies, one to vocalises and to various
other technical exercises under the direction of a teacher and before
a mirror to acquire the certainty that the singer did not make a
faulty movement of the face, the forehead, the eyes or the mouth. This
was the morning’s work. In the afternoon, a half-hour was given to
theory study, the same amount to writing counterpoint on plain-song
melodies, then to learning and applying the rules of composition
(writing on an erasable sheet); then followed a half-hour of study of
a literary nature, and the rest of the day was given to practice on
the clavichord, to the composition of a psalm, motet, canzonetta, or
any other kind of piece according to the pupil’s choice. Such were the
common exercises of those days when the pupils were kept on duty at
the school. On other days, they would go outside the Angelica Gate to
sing against the famous echo that was found there, listening to the
response in order to criticise their work. Other duties were to sing in
nearly all the musical solemnities of the various churches, to study
attentively the style of the great singers of the day, to make a report
of their observations to their master, who, the better to impress the
result of their studies upon the minds of his pupils, added remarks and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
advice as he deemed necessary. Under such discipline it is not
astonishing that the Italian singers attained a high degree of
excellence, and became not only distinguished singers but skilful
composers as well. That the reader may gather an idea of the character
of passages executed by these singers an example is given on the
previous page.</p>

<p><b>Growth of the Florid Style</b>.—As the art of singing developed,
the singers increased their capricious embellishments. With the idea of
securing brilliancy as well as the hope of winning success for their
works, composers yielded to the exactions of singers and the depraved
taste of the dilettanti. This explains the seemingly endless vocalizing
and those passages of pure agility which crowd the scores of the best
Italian masters of the 17th and 18th centuries. Before giving some
account of the famous singers of the old Italian school it will be
interesting to have a few notes upon a work on vocal music which bears
upon the matter of execution.</p>
<p><b>A Work on Singing</b>.—In 1725, <b>Pier Francesco Tosi</b>, a
renowned singer (born about 1650, died 1730), published a work,
translated into English, and published in 1742 under the title
“Observations on the Florid Song, or Sentiments of the Ancient
and Modern Singers,” which contains some interesting and valuable
statements for the student of the history of the art of singing. The
most minute principles are set forth with much grace and spirit, in
all cases showing enthusiasm on the part of the author for his art
and a high sense of the dignity of the profession of singing. When
the discussion is in regard to certain kinds of passages in which the
singer was accustomed to improvise ornaments, Tosi demands the union
of five qualities: intelligence, invention, meter (rhythm), mechanism
(technic) and taste; and in addition, other qualities which he calls
“secondary and auxiliary graces”: the appoggiatura, the trill, the
portamento di voce, phrasing. This work by Tosi and one by Marcello
entitled <i>Le Theatre à la Mode</i> throw much light on the execution of
the vocal music of the 18th century.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Seventeenth Century Singers</b>.—<b>Baldassare Ferri</b>
(1610-1680) was one of the most renowned of the male sopranos of the
old school. His voice had the greatest agility and facility, perfect
intonation, a brilliant shake or trill and his breath supply seemed
to be inexhaustible. In regard to his intonation, it is said that
he was able to ascend and descend in one breath a two-octave scale
with a continuous trill without accompaniment with such perfection
of intonation that when he finished he had not varied a shade from
the pitch of his starting-note. He was in high favor in the courts of
Poland, Germany, Sweden and England. A medal was struck in his honor.
<b>Antonio Bernacchi</b> (1690-1756) was a pupil of <b>Pistocchi</b>
(1659-1720), the most celebrated teacher in Italy at this time, whose
principles are represented in Tosi’s book. He commenced his career
early and appeared in opera in Italy, later in England and Germany.
After some years of experience with the public taste he altered his
style, making great use of the florid style, a veritable embroidery of
roulades, an innovation that was so successful as to be immediately
followed by other singers in spite of the protests of the older school
of singers. It is related that when Pistocchi heard his former pupil,
he said: “Ah! woe is me! I taught thee to sing and now thou wilt play!”
He sang in Handel’s opera company in London, 1729-30. He then returned
to Italy to take up the career of a teacher and brought out a number
of fine singers. <b>Francesco Bernardi Senesino</b> (1680-1750) was a
great favorite in England, where he sang in Handel’s operas. His voice
was exceptionally fine in quality, clear, penetrating and flexible,
his technic remarkable; his style was marked by purity, simplicity
and expressiveness, and his delivery of recitative was famous over
all Europe. The name of Niccolo Porpora was mentioned in connection
with the opera as a celebrated singing master as well as composer. No
singers before or since have sung like his pupils, notably Caffarelli and Farinelli.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Gaetano Majorano Caffarelli</b> (1703-1783)—the reader will note
that many of the old school of musicians lived to a ripe old age—was
the son of a Neapolitan peasant, who tried to repress the boy’s evident
musical inclinations. Cafaro, director of the Chapel Royal, at Naples,
chanced to hear him sing and succeeded in getting charge of him and
gave him his elementary instruction, which was followed by instruction
from Porpora, who was then living in Naples. Porpora was a most
exacting teacher, requiring implicit obedience and unceasing practice.
The story is told that Porpora kept Caffarelli for five or six years to
the unvaried study of a single page of exercises despite the pupil’s
most strenuous objections. At the end of the time, when Caffarelli
declared he would submit no longer, the old teacher said: “Go, my
son. I have nothing more to teach you. You are the greatest singer in
Europe.” When he first appeared in opera he sang female parts, for
which his beautiful face was well-suited. Some years later he took
men’s parts. He gained great popularity in the leading cities of Europe
and amassed an enormous fortune. He excelled in slow and pathetic airs,
yet he was most admirable in the bravura style, and his technic in the
trill and chromatic scales was unapproached by any other singer of his
time. He was fond of introducing chromatic passages in quick movements.</p>
<p><b>Farinelli</b> (1705-1782), whose real name was Carlo Broschi, was
a pupil of Porpora. He made his first public appearance in Rome when
he was seventeen years old. It was on this occasion that he sang the
famous aria with trumpet obligato, written by his master, a piece which
became so associated with him as to be demanded at all his concerts.
In this piece, trumpet and voice vie with each other in holding and
swelling a note of extraordinary length and volume; when the trumpeter
had exhausted his breath Farinelli kept on with increased power and
ended with a great vocal display. This aria called for wonderful
vocal technic owing to the novelty and difficulty of the trills and
variations introduced. In 1727, he engaged in a musical duel with
Bernacchi, previously referred to, in which he was conquered. As a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
result of this he placed himself under Bernacchi’s instruction, and
thus perfected his wonderful talent. In 1731, at the suggestion of the
Emperor Charles VI, he modified his style and devoted study to the
mastery of pathos and simplicity. During his public career he won the
greatest possible success in the European capitals and passed the last
years of his life in wealth. Mancini, a fellow-pupil of Farinelli and
later a famous singing master, says of Farinelli’s voice: “It was so
perfect, so powerful, so sonorous and so rich in its extent, both in
the high and the low parts of the register, that its equal has never
been heard in our time.... The art of taking and keeping the breath
so softly and easily that no one could perceive it began and ended
with him. The qualities in which he excelled were the evenness of his
voice, the art of swelling its sound, the portamento, the union of the
registers, a surprising agility, a graceful and pathetic style and a
shake as admirable as it was rare.”</p>
<p>A few other singers of this class may be mentioned: Giacchino Conti,
called <b>Gizziello</b> (1714-1761), <b>Giovanni Carestini</b>
(1705-1758?) a contralto, <b>Giuseppe Boschi</b>, the most celebrated
basso of the 18th century, one of Handel’s singers, and <b>Girolamo
Crescentini</b> (1766-1846). So much space has been given to these
singers because their work laid the principles for vocal training that
have ever since been the foundation upon which the great masters and
singers of later times have built their art; to these principles has
been given the name of the old Italian School of Singing.</p>
<p><b>Ill-effect of Virtuosity</b>.—The student who goes fully into the
subject of the relation of singers to the opera will find that the
great development of virtuosity among singers exerted an ill-effect and
called forth a very pronounced reform in which Gluck was the leader.
Singers were capable of such great vocal display, and the public showed
so much enthusiasm for the brilliant feats of vocalism, and so great
was the rivalry between singers and their partisans that composers vied
with each other in their efforts to introduce the most difficult and
florid passages possible. The text of an aria had no real value and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
became merely a vehicle upon which to place the dazzling vocalization
of the singer. Dramatic truth was ruthlessly sacrificed. A singer,
supposed to be in the very throes of death, would give a virtuosic
display that would tax the lung power of a man in the most perfect
physical condition. Gluck’s reform consisted in requiring that the
arias should express the emotions suited to the situation, thus calling
for expressive singing, not mere vocal display. The history of the
opera and singing since then shows periods of change toward one idea or
the other until the principles of Richard Wagner as to dramatic truth
were generally accepted.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Opera in France and England</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Spread of Italian Opera</b>.—The fame of Italian opera soon spread
to other countries. Princes and kings, eager to hear the new style of
music, held out golden inducements to Italian composers and singers to
come to their courts; it was generally thought that none but an Italian
could compose an opera or sing an aria. The consequence was that in
almost all countries during the 18th century the prevailing musical
influence was Italian; native composers and singers were obliged to
study Italian models if they wished to attain to popular favor. In
France, however, this influence was only sufficient to <i>modify</i> without
obscuring the features of an essentially national school. Independence
in matters of art has always been a marked characteristic of the
French; they have led rather than followed. The most distinguished
names in the history of French opera have been those of foreign birth,
but whatever their nationalities, all give evidence of the effect
exerted upon them by the definite form, the clearness of dramatic
intention demanded by the canons of French taste.</p>
<p><b>Origin of French Opera</b>.—As the Italian opera was derived from
the classical tragedy, so the <i>French opera</i> had its <i>origin</i> in the
<i>Ballet</i>, the favorite form of amusement in France. The French Ballet
of the 17th century was by no means confined to the dance; it was a
heterogeneous mingling of dances and dialogues, songs and choruses,
corresponding to the English Masque. Like the early operas in Italy,
their spectacular features were on a large and expensive scale, which
confined them to occasions of especial festivity at court or among the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
nobility. The taste for dancing had much to do with the direction
taken by the opera in France; it is still characteristic of the French
school, as is shown by the prominent place given to the ballet in the Grand Opera.</p>
<p><b>Lully</b>.—The founder of the French school, <b>Jean Baptiste
Lully</b> (1633-1687), was Italian by birth, but at the age of thirteen
he was taken from his native city, Florence, to France, as a page in
the service of the Chevalier de Guise. His musical gifts soon won him
a place in the royal band and finally the post of court composer. He
first wrote ballets in which the King (Louis XIV) himself danced, and
later turned his attention to the opera.</p>
<p><b>Italian Opera in France</b>.—Italian opera had already been heard
in France. Through Cardinal Mazarin, an opera company from Venice had
visited Paris in 1645, and two years later Peri’s <i>Euridice</i> had been
given also by a Venetian troupe; but these and later performances had
aroused no attempts at imitation by French composers. They contented
themselves with writing ballets which were performed as intermezzos
between the acts of Italian operas in order to bring them nearer the
French standards of taste. The superior vocal ability of the Italians
was acknowledged, but the lack of rhythmic form in their music made
an unfavorable impression. The king was passionately fond of dancing;
he and his courtiers frequently took part in the ballets produced at
court, hence the interest lay in the drama as illustrated by the dance
rather than by song.</p>
<p><b>Beginning of French Opera</b>.—The first French opera to receive
public performance was <i>Pomone</i> (Pomona), in 1671, by <b>Robert
Cambert</b> (1628-1677), who had previously written several others
which had been performed only in private. It awakened much more
interest than the Italian operas which thus far had been heard in
Paris, and incited Lully to the composition of his first opera, <i>Les
Fêtes de l’Amour et Bacchus</i> (The Feasts of Love and Bacchus), which
was produced the following year. From that time until his death he
composed fifteen operas, which determined the form of French opera for practically a century.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Characteristics of Lully’s Operas</b>.—Lully’s operas, like those
of the Florentine school, were on the whole <i>declamatory</i> in style, and
like them their subjects were generally taken from classical mythology.
They are destitute of the sustained melody which appeared somewhat
later in the Neapolitan school; but the recitatives are so skilfully
varied in rhythm and show such intimate knowledge of the genius of the
French language that in dramatic effect they are far superior to those
of the earlier school. To the overture, the ballet, the chorus, he
assigned music of a different type, rhythmic and formal in nature, thus
relieving the monotony of an exclusively declamatory style. A master of
stagecraft, his operas abounded in cunningly-devised spectacles and
original scenic effects which excited wonder and held the attention. In
short, so far as the means of the times allowed, we find in the Lully
operas the well-considered balance between the musical and dramatic
elements still characteristic of the French school.</p>
<p><b>The French Overture</b>.—One of Lully’s greatest services was the
elaboration of the Overture into a larger and more dignified form.
The Italians had never paid much attention to the overture. At first
it appeared only as a <i>brief instrumental prelude</i>, sometimes but a
few measures in length. The introduction to Monteverde’s <i>Orfeo</i>, for
example, consists of only nine measures which the composer directs
to be played over three times to serve as overture. Later it was
somewhat <i>extended</i> in length and provided with some regularity of
design, but the Overture as a fixed form dates from Lully. It began
with an impressive slow movement, followed by an Allegro in fugue
style. Sometimes this was all; but it generally concluded with another
slow movement, often one of the stately, dignified dance tunes of the
day, and often merely a repetition of the Introduction. This form was
known as the French Overture, and was soon adopted by composers of all
nationalities. About the middle of the 18th century it was supplanted
by the Italian Overture, perfected by Scarlatti, and described in Lesson XIX.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Prologue</b>.—The overture was commonly followed by a Prologue.
This had nothing to do with the action of the drama; it introduced
mythological and allegorical characters who danced and sang, often
paying the most fulsome adulation to the king, who was compared to the
most celebrated heroes of mythology and antiquity. After the prologue,
either the overture was repeated, or another and a shorter one was
played. This pseudo-classical type of opera naturally flourished in the
artificial atmosphere of the court on which it was dependent for favor.
It lasted until the time of Gluck, when the influences which led to the
great uprising of the people in the latter part of the 18th century
swept it away with other traditions and conventions.</p>
<p><b>Rameau</b>.—Until we come to <b>Jean Philippe Rameau</b>
(1683-1764), none of Lully’s successors succeeded in definitely
extending the limits he had fixed. Rameau had won the name of the first
theoretician of the day, and was a man of fifty when his first opera,
<i>Hippolyte et Aricie</i>, was produced. Even he made no essential change
in the scheme established by Lully beyond greatly enlarging the sphere
of the orchestra, originating novel rhythms and bolder harmonies.
This was, however, a long step in advance, since it saved the opera
from sinking to the level of a dull, mechanical imitation of Lully’s
methods, into which contemporary composers had fallen.</p>
<p><b>The English School</b>.—Italian music, in the form of the Madrigal,
had been popular in England since the time of its introduction in 1598,
by <b>Thomas Morley</b> (1557-1604). Native composers immediately took
it into favor, a favor it has never lost; madrigals are still composed
and sung in England, though elsewhere the form has been dead for nearly
two centuries. The declamatory opera of the early Italian school,
however, never took root. It was, as we have seen, primarily a drama in
which music played a secondary part, and as such it was far too crude
and lacking in human interest to appeal to a public accustomed to the
plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and whose taste in music,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
moreover, was rather for melody than for recitative. Then, during the
Protectorate, the Puritanical spirit which led to the destruction of
church organs and for a time forbade all theatrical performances proved
an insuperable obstacle to any development of dramatic music.</p>
<p><b>The First English Operas</b>.—In 1656, Sir William Davenant,
the playwright and theatrical manager, evaded this prohibition by
introducing music into his plays and calling them operas. Much of
this music, which was in the form of incidental songs, choruses and
instrumental interludes, was written by <b>Henry Lawes</b> (1595-1662)
and <b>Matthew Lock</b> (——d. 1677). The latter is well known for his
music to “Macbeth,” which up to within a few years was not infrequently
heard in performances of the tragedy. These so-called operas had
little or no effect on the development of a native school. They are
principally noteworthy in being the first English operas and the first
theatrical performances in England in which women appeared on the
stage. Previously the parts of women had been played by boys.</p>
<p><b>Influence of the French School</b>.—At the Restoration in 1660,
Charles II found the prevailing style of music in England but little
to his taste. Fond of the gay measures and lively dances of the French
opera, in 1664 he sent <b>Pelham Humfrey</b> (1647-1674), the most
talented of the boys forming the choir in the Chapel Royal, to Paris to
study with Lully. Three years later he returned, and became the teacher
of England’s greatest composer.</p>
<p><b>Henry Purcell</b>.—This was <b>Henry Purcell</b> (1658-1695), one
of a family of musicians of whom he stands first. As a child he is said
to have composed anthems while a chorister in the Chapel Royal, and at
the age of twenty-two he composed his first opera, <i>Dido and Eneas</i>, a
most remarkable work for a youth of his years. It is the only one of
his dramatic works in which there is <i>no spoken dialogue</i>, its place
being supplied by recitative, and therefore, strictly speaking, it
was his only opera. He can never have seen an opera of this type; his
acquaintance with the new style must have been largely based on what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Humfrey had told him of such performances in Paris, though it is
possible that he had the opportunity of studying Lully’s scores. In its
union of dramatic feeling and characterization with depth of musical
resource, <i>Dido and Eneas</i> was far in advance of anything that had
yet appeared in France or Italy. Though it shows the influence of the
French school, the sturdy English character which distinguishes all of
Purcell’s music is plainly apparent.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Henry Purcell</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Purcell’s Dramatic Works</b>.—It was followed by a large number of
works for the stage, but these were in the main merely incidental music
for dramas; among them Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” “Midsummer Night’s
Dream” (known as The Fairy Queen), Dryden’s “King Arthur,” the last
being the most important and extended in form. Unfortunately, many of
them have been lost; but enough remain to show that in Purcell’s early
death England lost the most original musical genius she ever possessed.
He founded a distinctly national school which, for the lack of a
successor of equal gifts, was destined to succumb to foreign influences.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Their Characteristics</b>.—His melodies bear the freshness and
spontaneity of the English Folk-song at a period when music was
generally cultivated, before civil wars and religious bigotry had
crushed the art spirit which, during the 16th century, had made the
English people the leaders in musical progress. His recitatives show
a vigor and an intuitive perception of dramatic effect unsurpassed by
any of his contemporaries on the Continent. He was an accomplished
contrapuntist and applied his knowledge of counterpoint with admirable
results to sacred music, yet never allowed it to become obtrusive in
his dramatic works. In these clear, expressive melody and vigorous
declamation were the distinguishing features; his learning served only
to secure a natural flow of the one and an appropriate setting for the other.</p>
<p><b>The Masque</b>.—The precursor of the English opera was the Masque.
Like the French Ballet, this was a dramatic entertainment consisting of
dialogues, dances, songs, and choruses. The subject was allegorical or
mythical in nature and the mounting of the most elaborate description.
The leading poets and dramatists of the day wrote many masques. The
most famous was Milton’s “Masque of Comus,” the music by Lawes, which
was performed at Ludlow Castle in 1634. The music in these masques
was at first designed merely to give variety to what was in the main
a pleasure to the eye, but Purcell relieved it of this subordinate
character by investing it with a weight and authority which made it an
integral factor in the dramatic expression.</p>
<p><b>Typical English Opera</b>.—He thus fixed the form of the <i>English
opera</i> as a <i>play with songs, choruses, ensembles</i>, etc., connected by
<i>spoken dialogue</i> instead of recitatives. The music, therefore, instead
of carrying on the action, is confined to the more quiet situations
of the drama, such as are naturally adapted to lyrical expression.
The inflexibility of this form has doubtless had much to do with the
lack of development in the English School of Opera compared with the
remarkable growth of other schools which have abandoned the union of
the spoken with the sung word in the serious opera.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Ballad Opera</b>.—The only characteristic creation of the
English school is the Ballad Opera. This had its origin in “The
Beggar’s Opera,” produced in 1728. Slight in texture, it was simply a
play with songs set to the most popular ballad tunes of the day. Its
extraordinary success in the face of the financial failure of Italian
opera left no doubt as to the real taste of the English people, and
was decisive as to the direction taken by later composers, such as
<b>Sir Henry Bishop</b> (1786-1855), <b>Michael Balfe</b> (1808-1870),
<b>Arthur Sullivan</b> (1842-1901).</p>

<h2>LESSON XXII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Opera in Germany. Handel and Gluck</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Opera in Germany</b>.—The introduction of the opera into Germany
dates from 1627. In that year a German translation of Rinuccini’s
<i>Dafne</i>, which, it will be remembered, was the text of Peri’s first
opera, was set to music by <b>Heinrich Schuetz</b> (1585-1672) and
performed on the occasion of the wedding of the Landgraf of Hesse.
Schütz, who also composed the first German oratorio, <i>Die Auferstehung
Christi</i> (The Resurrection of Christ), had been sent by the Landgraf
to study in Italy in 1609, only two years after the production of
Monteverde’s <i>Orfeo</i>. The score of his <i>Dafne</i> has been lost, but it
was doubtless in accordance with the principles of the Florentine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
school. The Thirty Years’ War and its lamentable consequences prevented
any immediate development of the new form. Occasional productions of
Italian opera were given in several German cities, but it was not until
the establishment of the Hamburg opera late in the century that the new
musical movement gained a permanent footing in Germany. Even then its
popularization proceeded but slowly.</p>

</div>
<p><b>German Composers Barred</b>.—It is true that not long after the
beginning of the 18th century, great interest was manifested in Italian
opera at a number of courts, Berlin and Dresden in particular, but this
had <i>no influence</i> in the formation of a <i>national school</i>. Its effect
indeed was the exact contrary. Singers and composers were brought from
Italy; among the cultivated classes opera in German was considered a
barbarism, so that native musicians met with little or no encouragement
in this field. They were obliged to write their operas to an Italian
text if they wished a hearing for them; the Church alone was freely
open to German composers. The Church, too, was the only place where
the people could hear music; public concerts were unknown and, save at
Hamburg, the opera could be heard only by invitation to those who had
entrée to court circles. This led to the remarkable activity in the
production of sacred music which is such a feature of that period. This
also, as shown by the early history of the Hamburg opera, was more in
consonance with German character than the light, ephemeral operas which
ruled the Italian stage.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Early German Opera</b>.—The Hamburg opera
house was opened in 1678 with a Biblical <i>Singspiel</i> (literally
song-play) of an allegorical nature, <i>Adam und Eva; oder der
erschaffene, gefallene und wieder aufgerichtete Mensch</i> (Adam and
Eve; or the Created, Fallen and Redeemed Man) by <b>Johann Theile</b>
(1646-1724) a noted organist of the day and a pupil of Schütz. This
was the first performance of a German opera on a public stage. The
<i>Singspiel</i> corresponds to the English ballad opera in being a series
of songs, ensembles, etc., mainly of a simple nature, connected by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
spoken dialogue. The curious taste of the time is shown by the choice
of subject; the work itself was a survival of the Miracle Plays and
Mysteries of the Middle Ages. It begins with the creation of the earth,
which is formed out of chaos by characters representing the four
elements; the Almighty descends by means of a flying machine and calls
man into being; Lucifer succeeds in his temptation of Eve to the great
joy of demons who sing an exulting chorus, etc. As the Italians took
the subjects for their early operas from classical mythology, so the
<i>Germans took</i> theirs from <i>Bible history</i>. <i>Adam and Eve</i> was followed
by a series of similar <i>Singspiele</i>: <i>Michal and David</i>, <i>The Maccabean
Mother</i>, <i>Esther</i>, <i>Cain and Abel</i>, and many others.</p>
<p><b>Change of Character</b>.—In time, however, these gave way to operas
in the Italian style. The chief agent in this change was <b>Reinhard
Keiser</b> (1674-1739) who, as composer and manager, brought the
Hamburg opera to its highest point. Associated with him was <b>Johannes
Mattheson</b> (1681-1764), a man of many and varied gifts as singer,
composer, conductor, scholar and diplomat, now chiefly remembered by
his close relations with <b>George Frederic Handel</b> (1685-1759).
The latter at the age of eighteen came from his native city, Halle, to
Hamburg, then the musical centre of Germany, to continue his studies.
Mattheson recognized the youth’s genius and opened the way for the
performance of his first opera, <i>Almira</i>.</p>
<p><b>Handel and the Hamburg Opera</b>.—This, with <i>Nero</i>, was given in
1705 with such success that Keiser, jealous of the young composer, set
them both to music himself and banished his rival’s works from the
stage. Handel thereupon withdrew and the year following went to Italy,
where he spent several years. His connection with the Hamburg opera
was too slight for him to have exercised any influence upon it; then,
too, he had not yet reached artistic independence himself, and it is
doubtful whether he would have made any change in the direction it was
taking toward conventionalized Italian opera. At that time the Hamburg
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
opera was rapidly losing its national character; the style mainly
cultivated was that of the Neapolitan school; a tasteless mingling of
languages was even allowed in one and the same opera—the recitatives
were often sung in German and the arias in Italian. This decadence
continued, with a consequent loss of popular favor, until in 1738 opera
in German was given up entirely, and Italian opera reigned triumphant in Germany.</p>
<p><b>The Conventionalized Italian Opera</b>.—Handel, on his return
from Italy, finally found his way to England, where he made his home
for the rest of his life. The series of operas he produced there
form the <i>climax of the type originated by Scarlatti</i>, which by this
time flourished on all stages to the exclusion of all others, save
in France, where the ideals of Lully and his school still prevailed.
Its chief aim was to afford singers an opportunity to display their
accomplishments. To this end the composer directed his attention
principally to the production of arias which should correspond to this
demand. Exquisitely beautiful as these often were, their preponderance
completely obscured the dramatic significance of the opera, and led the
singers to entertain grossly exaggerated ideas of their importance.
They dictated to composers, refused to sing what in their opinion
failed to suit their voices, and in many ways kept the opera from
rising above the low artistic level to which it had fallen. To please
them, a highly artificial scheme of arrangement was adopted to which
the drama was totally subservient. Only six characters were allowed,
three men and three women; the arias were strictly classified according
to style and assigned to the singers in a certain fixed order; no
ensemble beyond a duet was permitted, and the chorus sang only in
the closing finale. No matter what the dramatic exigencies might be,
adherence to these formulæ was rigidly exacted.</p>
<p><b>Handel’s Operas</b>.—Though Handel infused a vigor of spirit and
a wealth of characteristic melody into this form of opera, he made no
definite attempt to escape its restrictions. Many of his most beautiful
creations are buried in operas which are dead beyond possibility of
resurrection on account of his acquiescence in the sentiment of his
times. That this is not due to lack of innate power is shown by his oratorios.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Christoph Willibald Gluck</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Gluck and His Reform of the Opera</b>.—This so-called concert opera
reigned with almost undisputed sway until the influence of <b>Christoph
Willibald Gluck</b> (1714-1787) wrought a momentous change. Persuaded
of the low estate to which the opera had been reduced, Gluck stood for
a return to first principles; he advocated a ruthless sacrifice of the
conventionalities which through the vanity of singers and the love of
sensation on the part of the public had grown up around the opera and
the placing of it upon its original foundation of the drama. He was a
man of mature years when in 1762 he put his theories into practice by
the production of <i>Orfeo</i> in Vienna. He had composed many operas in the
prevailing Italian style, but his judgment, formed by extensive study
and travel, convinced him of the essential weakness of that school: its
concentration upon the purely musical element. This he saw made of the
opera a puppet-show for the display of vocal art which, great as it
was from a technical point of view, was mechanical and meretricious in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
character. He was not alone in his condemnation; critics and thinkers
such as Addison and Steele in England, Diderot in France, Marcello and
Algarotti in Italy had employed the varied resources of wit, satire and
reason to expose the follies and inconsistencies of the opera. From the
nature of the case, however, they could work no change; most of them
were literary men who could criticise but not create.</p>
<p><b>Gluck’s Travels and their Influence</b>.—Gluck had traveled much.
There was hardly an art-centre in Europe from Copenhagen to Naples
which he had not visited for the purpose of bringing out his works. In
England, he had heard Handel’s oratorios, which profoundly impressed
him; in Paris, he had made acquaintance with Rameau’s operas. Both
of these masters exercised a strong influence over his change of
style; the former by his powerful handling of the chorus which had
been practically banished from the Italian stage, the latter by his
consistent adherence to dramatic truth of expression. He was in
addition a zealous student of art and literature in all their phases;
he brought to his problem not only the ear of the musician but the
intellect of the scholar.</p>
<p>“<b>Orfeo</b>.”—In <i>Orfeo</i>, Gluck took the same stand which Peri
had taken in his opera on the same myth a century and a half before:
the <i>illustration of the drama through music</i> which should give it a
poignancy of expression denied to the spoken word. The later composer
had the immense advantage of musical resources undreamed-of at the
time of the Florentine opera, but both stand upon the same artistic
platform. It was a daring task that Gluck had attempted. Orpheus,
robbed by death of Euridice, seeks to regain her by forcing entrance to
the place of departed spirits. On his descent to the nether world he is
confronted by a band of demons who bar his way, but finally melted to
tears by the pathos of his song, they allow him to pass. The composer
must make this appeal adequate to the effect; anything less would
result in an anti-climax totally disastrous to dramatic illusion. Gluck
passed this test triumphantly. Even today this scene remains one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
most powerful known to the operatic stage. <i>Orfeo</i>, in its strength and
simplicity, was so opposed to the taste of the day that its victory was
by no means unquestioned, but it soon won universal recognition and
with its successor, <i>Alceste</i> (1767), is the oldest opera heard
at the present day.</p>
<p><b>Gluck in Paris</b>.—<i>Alceste</i> was followed by <i>Paride ed Elena</i>
(Paris and Helen), but the severity of the new style aroused such a
storm of hostile criticism that the discouraged composer turned to
Paris with his <i>Iphigenie en Aulide</i> (Iphigenia in Aulis) to a French
text after Racine’s tragedy. Marie Antoinette, then the wife of the
Dauphin, had been his pupil in Vienna, and through her influence
the opera was produced, though not without arousing one of the most
bitter wars in musical annals. Twelve years before, Italian <i>Opera
Buffa</i> had gained a footing in Paris. Its lightness, melodic grace,
and witty dramatic situations captivated many who immediately attacked
the prevailing type of French opera, of which Rameau was the head, as
heavy and unmusical. This opinion was strenuously combated by others
who upheld native art. Thus there were two strongly-opposed parties,
one defending the Italian, the other the French school of opera. After
Rameau’s death, the Italian party was in the ascendency, but on Gluck’s
arrival with a French opera he was taken as the representative of the
national school. Piccini, the most popular Italian composer of the day,
was pitted against him, but it needed only the production of Gluck’s
<i>Iphigenie en Tauride</i> (Iphigenia in Tauris) to crush his rival’s
claims. This was his last great work. He retired to Vienna, which was
his home until his death.</p>
<p><b>Influence of Gluck</b>.—The influence exerted by Gluck was
far-reaching and permanent. The reform he initiated did not create a
school—it did far more; it <i>profoundly affected all schools</i>. With no
immediate followers among the composers of his time he stood alone, as
he stands today, one of the most commanding figures in musical history.
His <i>Orfeo</i> marks the beginning of a new era by rescuing a great and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
important form of art from a decadence which had robbed it of
legitimate power and effect. The opera more than any other form of
music is dependent upon popular favor for existence. It is therefore
peculiarly susceptible to influences which tend to lower artistic
standards. Gluck, however, made it impossible that it should ever again
sink to the level of the mass of crudities and puerilities from which
he lifted it.</p>

the development of the Opera. Frederick the Great’s grandfather and
father laid the foundations of the Prussian kingdom. In France, Gluck’s
works carry us up to the period of social and political agitation
preceding the French Revolution. In England, the House of Hanover is
becoming more firmly established on the throne; in America, the period
is that of the struggles between the French and English colonists.

<h2>LESSON XXIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Mozart to Rossini</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Opera after Gluck</b>.—After Gluck the first great name is that
of <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b> (1756-1791). Haydn had indeed written
a number of operas, but they were, in the main, light in character and
exercised no influence whatever on the development of the form. At the
age of twelve, Mozart had composed two operas, but the first to receive
public performance was <i>Mitridate, Re di Ponto</i> (Mithridates, King of
Pontus), which was produced at Milan two years later under his own
direction. This was followed by others, but these early works do not
call for any extended mention. Though they abound in melody and show a
maturity remarkable in so young a composer, they were frankly written
to please the taste of the time and do not in any essentials depart
from the accepted Italian style then in favor, as fixed by Scarlatti
and his contemporaries.</p>
<p><b>Gluck and Mozart Compared</b>.—It was not until <i>Idomeneo, Re di
Creta</i> (Idomeneus, King of Crete) was brought out during the Carnival
season of 1781, that he demonstrated fully the gifts which made him the
first dramatic composer of his time. In this he shows a great advance
over the conventional opera of the period and an approach to the ideals
of Gluck, though neither in <i>Idomeneo</i> nor in any of his later operas
did he attempt to embody these ideals in the uncompromising form chosen
by the older master. Though contemporaries, no two composers could
well be more unlike in character, temperament and methods than Gluck
and Mozart. The one, a man of years, ripened through travel and study,
conditioned his music according to the requirements of the drama; the
other, a youth of no great intellectual endowments aside from his art,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
but aflame with the fire of genius, felt the drama in terms of music.
Thus they approached the task from opposite sides. Not that Gluck was
without feeling or Mozart without intellect; it was simply a case of
the dramatist and the musician solving the problem each in his own
way. At the same time it was impossible that Gluck’s theories should
be entirely without influence on Mozart. Even a genius must learn from
his environment, and Gluck’s position, though sharply disputed by the
Italian school to which Mozart belonged, could not be ignored by the
younger man. Then, too, Mozart had been in Paris during the height
of the Gluck-Piccini controversy, and it is known that he had made a
close study of <i>Alceste</i>, to which Gluck, in the form of a dedication
to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, had given a preface containing a clear
exposition of his principles of dramatic composition. It is hard to
say, however, what direction Mozart’s dramatic course might have taken
had his life not been cut so pitilessly short and if his outward
circumstances had been less constrained. He was obliged to adapt
himself to Italian influences which at that time were all powerful.</p>
<p><b>The Singspiel</b>.—As already mentioned, the first attempts at
German opera took the form of the <i>Singspiel</i>, but it gradually died
out during the invasion of Italian opera in Germany. Its revival and
development to a higher standard was due to <b>Johann Adam Hiller</b>
(1728-1804), who received his first impulse through an English ballad
opera of a farcical nature, “The Devil to Pay.” This was translated
into German and given (1743) at Berlin with the original English
melodies taken from popular ballads. Hiller set this translation to
music and followed it with many others which soon acquired great vogue;
one or two, for example, <i>Der Dorfbarbier</i> (The Village Barber),
are still heard in Germany. Hiller, though one of the most learned
musicians of the day, the founder of the celebrated Gewandhaus Concerts
in Leipzig and editor of the first musical periodical ever published,
adopted a simple, natural Folk-style in these operettas, as they were
also called. Goethe was particularly interested in this revival of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
national form of opera; it stimulated him to the writing of the ballads
which in turn acted so powerfully in developing the German song under
the hands of Loewe, Schubert, Schumann and others.</p>
<p><b>Mozart’s First German Opera</b>.—Emperor Joseph II, wishing to
establish the <i>Singspiel</i> in Vienna, commissioned Mozart to write a
German opera of a similar style. This resulted in <i>Die Entführung aus
dem Serail</i> (The Elopement from the Seraglio), and the composer’s hopes
of founding a national school of opera were high. Unfortunately, he
was doomed to disappointment. Though <i>Die Entführung</i> was received
with enthusiasm, popular favor was averse to opera in any other tongue
than Italian; the German theatre was open only a few years and with
the exception of <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>, his future operas were composed
to Italian texts.</p>
<p><b>His Later Operas</b>.—<i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i> (The Marriage of
Figaro—1786), <i>Don Giovanni</i> (Don Juan—1788), <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>
(The Magic Flute—1791) rank as Mozart’s greatest operas. Considered
as music alone, the last reaches a height which gives an idea of what
he might have done in nationalizing the opera if he had been spared a
score of years longer; but its confused, irrational plot stands in the
way of its popularization. The same objection holds good of <i>Così fan
Tutte</i> (Women are All Alike—1790), which contains some of his most
exquisite music.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of Mozart’s Operas</b>.—Mozart’s <i>conception</i> of
the opera is that of the <i>musician</i>, <i>not</i> of the <i>dramatist</i>. This
is plain from the indifferent texts he willingly accepted, yet so
universal was his genius that he fused the two elements into a complete
and consistent whole. Such a union of clearly-cut characterization and
musical beauty is unknown in the opera. He made his <i>characters eternal
types</i> by means of music so apposite to their individuality that it
seems in each case to spring from inward necessity, yet which as music
has never been surpassed for intrinsic grace and charm. Italian melody
in its best estate on a foundation of German depth and solidity is
its distinguishing characteristic. This characterization is confined,
however, to details and personages; of the development of the drama as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
a whole he apparently had but little idea. This, however, was not
called for by the taste of the times; the opera was not considered from
a dramatic standpoint, save by Gluck and the composers of the French
school; the libretto furnished a series of situations suitable for
musical illustration, not a consistent and logical dramatic action.</p>
<p><b>Their Significance to German Art</b>.—Mozart marks the highest
point reached by the opera of the 18th century; he also <i>marks the
passing of Italian supremacy in Germany</i>. The Germans were already
masters of the other great forms, the Oratorio and the Symphony; Gluck
and Mozart captured the Opera also for Germany, though it was not for
several decades after Mozart’s death that German opera rose from its
discredited position at the close of the century.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven’s Fidelio</b>.—A mighty impulse was given to the
development of a national school by the production of <i>Fidelio</i> (1805),
Beethoven’s only opera. His two great predecessors had been obliged
for the most part to write their operas to French and Italian texts.
<b>Beethoven</b> (1770-1827), however, showed his independence and
sturdy national character by choosing a subject totally alien to the
frivolous intrigues which at that time ruled the Viennese stage—a
story of heroic, wifely devotion—and composed it to German words and
in the German style; that is, with dialogue instead of recitative.
Essentially symphonic in character, <i>Fidelio</i> shows the same disregard
of vocal limitations which characterizes the Ninth Symphony and the
Mass in D. Difficult for the singers, it was still more difficult for
the public. In subject and treatment it was above their heads; they
turned it the cold shoulder and it soon disappeared from the boards. An
appreciation of its greatness was reserved for a later day.</p>
<p><b>Italian Composers in France and Germany</b>.—The popularity of
Italian opera outside of Italy led to the expatriation of many Italian
composers who exercised a powerful influence in France and Germany.
Among these <b>Antonio Salieri</b> (1750-1825) deserves mention for his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
career in Vienna, where he was the successful rival of Mozart in court
favor and later the teacher of Beethoven. More important was <b>Luigi
Cherubini</b> (1760-1842), who found his way to Paris just before the
Revolution. A master of the severe contrapuntal school, which was then
passing away, Beethoven considered him the first composer of the day
for the stage and studied his works zealously. Cherubini was present
at the first performance of <i>Fidelio</i>, which shows strong traces of
the influence exerted upon Beethoven by <i>Les Deux Journées</i> (The Two
Days, known in Germany and England as The Water Carrier), Cherubini’s
greatest opera. The two were on intimate terms during the stay of the
latter in Vienna for the purpose of bringing out several of his operas.
There was much in common between them; the Italian had the solidity,
dignity and nobility of treatment generally associated with the German
character. Beethoven’s choice of a subject for his opera was doubtless
influenced by <i>Les Deux Journées</i>; the themes of both are much the
same, involving devotion and self-sacrifice of the highest order.</p>
<p><b>Spontini and Rossini</b>.—Another Italian composer who went
first to France and afterward to Germany was <b>Gasparo Spontini</b>
(1774-1851), who with <i>La Vestale</i> (The Vestal) enlarged the sphere
of the opera in Paris. Spectacular and pompous in character, sonorous
and powerful in instrumentation, it pointed directly to the type of
grand opera originated by Meyerbeer nearly a generation later. In
1820, he was summoned to Berlin, where he remained as court composer
and conductor for twenty-two years, a period coincident with the most
significant development of the German school of opera. Spontini was the
last of the many Italians who had for a century and a half borne almost
uninterrupted sway in Germany.</p>
<p class="space-below2">The most brilliant and gifted of all these
wandering sons of Italy was <b>Gioacchino Rossini</b> (1792-1868). As
rich in melody as Mozart, though of a less refined type, he owed more
to nature than to study. His first successful opera, <i>Tancredi</i> (1813),
set all Italy agog with the freshness and vivacity of its airs, and
it was not long before he <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> was the most popular composer in
Europe. Gifted with prodigious facility—in one period of eight years he
wrote twenty operas—his operas ruled all stages and fixed the standard
by which all others were judged.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="582" src="images/image224.jpg" width="450" id="img_images_image224.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Gioacchino Rossini</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Characteristics of Rossini’s Operas</b>.—They are, on the whole,
a <i>reversion</i> to the conventionalized opera of Handel’s time in being
written for the singer to exhibit his art and not to express the
significance of the drama; this notwithstanding their undoubted charm,
the many piquant and original touches in rhythm and harmony, the
occasional suggestive instrumentation. An intensely <i>florid style</i> is
used not only in the <i>buffa</i> school where it can readily be justified,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
but in operas of a tragic nature where it is manifestly out of place.
In <i>Semiramide</i>, for instance, a story of battle, murder and sudden
death is told in the same rippling rhythms and highly ornamented
melodies that illustrate the intrigues of his <i>Barbiere di Siviglia</i>
(Barber of Seville), where they are eminently appropriate.</p>
<p><b>His Change of Style</b>.—This is true, however, only of his works
composed for the Italian stage. His <i>Guillaume Tell</i> (William Tell),
produced in 1829, five years after his arrival in Paris, showed the
influence of his new environment by an almost startling change of
style. Elevated and dramatic in treatment, shorn of redundant ornament
as befits the character of the subject—taken from Schiller’s play of
the same name—it remains his greatest achievement; at least in serious
opera. It was also his last work for the stage. It is not known by what
strange caprice he practically closed his career as composer at the age
of thirty-nine.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Oratorio</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Oratorio in Italy after Carissimi</b>.—After the beginning made
by Carissimi, the next work of importance in Oratorio is that of
<b>Alessandro Scarlatti</b>, who established the Aria form as explained
in the study of the Opera. The composers of the Italian school of the
last part of the 17th and the early part of the 18th century used
practically the same methods in Opera and Oratorio, the difference
being mainly in the character of the text, and in the earnestness or
religious feeling of the composer. Scarlatti is also signalized by
his improvements in the Recitative, which resulted in several forms
made use of by his successors, <i>Recitativo Secco</i> and Accompanied
Recitative. He wrote ten oratorios. Contemporaries whose work should
be mentioned are <b>Antonio Caldara</b> (1678-1763) and <b>Leonardo
Leo</b> (1694-1746), a pupil of Scarlatti, who wrote nearly a hundred
works for the church, the chief one being the oratorio, <i>Santa Elena
al Calvario</i> and a <i>Miserere</i> for a double choir. He was strong in
his writing for chorus, making splendid use of the fugal style.
Another contemporary of the first rank was <b>Alessandro Stradella</b>
(1645-1681), whose oratorio, <i>San Giovanni Battista</i> (St. John the
Baptist) is a most beautiful work. It contains a free treatment of the
accompanying instruments, the arias are clear and well-designed, the
chorus writing for five parts is effective as well as ingenious, and
the work as a whole shows considerable power of dramatic expression,
forming a sort of transition between Scarlatti and Handel. Stradella is
said to have been a pupil of Carissimi.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Oratorio in Germany</b>.—In Oratorio as in Opera, the style spread
to other countries, there, in the case of the Oratorio, ultimately to
find a more congenial home; for the Oratorio, in Italy after the time
of Stradella, seemed to lose hold on composers and public. The latter
did not grasp the fact that the Oratorio had within it one element,
the chorus, to give to it a definite individuality. They submitted to
the public’s preference for solo singing and made up their oratorios
largely of conventional arias—thus inviting comparison with the Opera,
and reserved their writing in choral form for their works for the
Church service, such as psalms, magnificats, masses and motets. In
Germany, the attitude of the people toward religious music, doubtless
owing to the Reformation as well as to the serious nature of the
people, was much more favorable than in Italy. This temperament is
shown by the fact that when German composers cast about for themes for
their oratorios they seemed to choose the story of the Passion. The
oldest example of the German Oratorio is “The Resurrection of Christ,”
written by <b>Heinrich Schuetz</b> (1585-1672), a pupil of Giovanni
Gabrieli, which was produced at Dresden in 1623. The narrative portions
were committed almost entirely to the chorus. We mention also a setting
of the Passion, by <b>Johann Sebastiani</b>, published in 1672, which
contains interspersed chorales, sung as arias by one voice with violin
accompaniment, and by <b>Reinhard Keiser</b> (1674-1739).</p>
<p><b>Use of the Chorale</b>.—A step in advance was taken when German
composers began to use the chorale of the German Protestant Church
as the subject for contrapuntal elaboration, a tendency shown in the
work of Sebastiani referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Chorale
had absorbed into itself the spirit of the Volkslied, and its use
supplied the medium for the public to enter fully into the spirit of
the oratorio. Two composers who developed the “Passion Music” idea
to its height, <b>Karl Heinrich Graun</b> (1701-1759) and <b>Johann
Sebastian Bach</b>, made the Chorale an integral part of their works.
The greatest work in oratorio form written by Graun was called <i>Der Tod Jesu</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
(The Death of Jesus), which was first produced in the Cathedral
at Berlin in 1755. This work consists of recitatives, airs and
choruses, the fugal treatment of the latter being admirable in point of
clearness of design and breadth of form. Graun used in this oratorio
six chorales. <i>Der Tod Jesu</i>, owing to a bequest, is still given in Berlin.</p>
<p><b>Bach</b>.—The greatest of all the settings of the Passion are
those by <b>Johann Sebastian Bach</b> (1685-1750). The first work
in this style by Bach was the one according to “St. John,” in 1723,
first performed on Good Friday, 1724, at Leipzig. This work, fine as
it is, must yield to the second setting, according to “St. Matthew,”
first produced on Good Friday, 1729, afterward revised and given again
in 1740. A few notes on the “Passion according to St. Matthew” will
serve for both works. The characters introduced are Jesus, Judas,
Peter, Pilate, the Apostles and the People. Certain reflections on
the narrative are interpreted by a chorus. The text which furnishes
the narrative is assigned to the principal tenor. Fifteen chorales
of the Lutheran Church are introduced, and in the singing of these
the general congregation was expected to join. The choruses contain
powerful and dramatic vocal effects, and though not strictly fugal are
intricate in their part-writing. A double chorus is used, each chorus
having a separate orchestra and organ accompaniment. The performance of
this work (St. Matthew Passion) was restricted to Leipzig in the 18th
century, and was discontinued altogether in the 19th until Mendelssohn
revived it in 1829. It is given very frequently at the present day
during the Lenten season, in part or in full. The “Christmas Oratorio”
(1734) is really a series of cantatas for each of the first days of the
Christmas week, and contains no new ideas so far as form is concerned.</p>
<p><b>Stabat Mater</b>.—In connection with the “Passion” reference
should be made to the Latin hymn, “Stabat Mater,” which has been made
the subject of treatment in oratorio form, by <b>Palestrina</b>,
<b>Giovanni Battista Pergolesi</b> (1710-1736) for soprano and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
contralto accompanied by strings and organ, <b>Emanuele d’Astorga</b>
(1681-1736) for four voices with instrumental accompaniment, the more
modern work, in large form, by <b>Gioacchino Rossini</b> (1792-1868),
most beautiful as music if partaking too much, as critics say, of
the sensuous, and the magnificent setting of <b>Antonin Dvořák</b>
(1841-1904). This work has been placed, by musicians and the public, in
the category of the world’s masterpieces of choral writing.</p>
<p><b>George Friedrich Handel</b> (1685-1759).—We now come to Bach’s
contemporary, the greatest name in the history of the Oratorio, to
the composer who brought to his work a musical learning equal to that
of Bach, German earnestness and mastery of contrapuntal science,
tempered by knowledge of and experience in Italian vocal methods,
producing simple, clear melody supported by rich, firm harmonies, a
complete mastery of the orchestra of the day, a clear understanding
of the value of the chorus in working out dramatic effects; and this
combination was offered a congenial field for labor in England, one
of the great Protestant countries of Europe, with a deep reverence
for religion and for the narratives of the Bible and the truths and
lessons they enforce. This latter point is strikingly present in the
texts of Handel’s oratorios; the symbolic meaning of the narrative is
clearly indicated and made the central thought of the work, producing
a remarkable effect of Unity. As a writer has said: “Handel preaches
through the voices of his chorus.” The orchestra for which Handel
wrote was smaller than the full orchestra to which we are accustomed
today. The proportion of string players to the whole number of players
was smaller, but on the other side, more than two oboes and bassoons
were used; flutes were most frequently used as solo instruments or to
double the part of the oboes; the clarinet Handel never used, doubtless
because of its imperfections, which were not remedied until later;
the brass instruments used were trumpets with kettle drums for their
natural bass, horns and the three trombones, alto, tenor and bass;
other instruments of a soft-voiced quality, like the harp, viola da
gamba, were occasionally used for obligato accompaniments. The organ was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
always used, the part being written according to the figured bass
system, and the harpsichord was used by the conductor. The reader who
is able to analyze one of Handel’s oratorio scores will be surprised to
note the superb effects he makes with comparatively small resources.
Compared with the polyphonic writing of his predecessors and his great
contemporary, Bach, his fugues seem light and simple, but that very
thing gives them their admirable clearness and purity; compared with
later works, his diatonic progressions and harmonies based on common
chords seem colorless, especially so in contrast with the kaleidoscopic
chromatic figures and strongly dissonant harmonies of the newer school;
yet in this point is the strength of Handel’s works with the public;
simplicity is valued more highly than complexity, naturalness rather
than the indications of science.</p>
<p>Handel wrote seventeen works that can be classed as oratorios. The
first of these was “Esther,” in 1720, revised and brought out anew
in 1732. In 1733 “Deborah,” perhaps best-known for a powerful double
chorus, was offered to the public; “Athaliah” in the same year. In
1739 came “Saul” and “Israel in Egypt,” the former best-known today
for its famous “Dead March,” the latter for the music descriptive of
the plagues. In 1741, he wrote his greatest oratorio “The Messiah,”
which was first performed publicly, April 13, 1742, in Dublin. In this
we find a certain reflective character which recalls the Passion music
of the German school. The only other oratorio which is still given in
anything like entirety is “Judas Maccabæus” (1747); other works from
which certain portions are still in use are “Samson” (1743), “Solomon”
(1749), “Theodora” (1750), a work which Handel considered his best, and
“Jephtha” (1752). Great as was Handel’s fame in England, the character
of his works and the forms he used made little or no impression upon
German and Italian composers. <b>Johann Adolph Hasse</b> (1699-1783),
<b>Niccolo Porpora</b> (1686-1767), <b>Antonio Sacchini</b>
(1734-1786), <b>Giovanni Paisiello</b> (1741-1816), <b>Niccolo
Jommelli</b> (1714-1774) and <b>Pietro Guglielmi</b> (1727-1804) wrote
in the Italian style, and their works are, properly speaking, concert
oratorios, scarcely distinguishable from the opera save by the text.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Franz Joseph Haydn</b>.—The next name of importance is that of
Haydn (1732-1809), who wrote “The Creation” and “The Seasons” toward
the end of a long life, after his work as a composer had given him a
command of musical resources excelled only by Beethoven, who did not
equal him in skill in writing effectively and suitably for voices. It
was in 1798 that “The Creation” was first given in Vienna. The score
abounds in effective writing for the solo voices, in the florid style
and in the conventional aria form, and in brilliant choruses which,
however, cannot compare in dignity and breadth with those of Handel.
The orchestral accompaniments are much more elaborate than those used
by Handel, as can naturally be expected from a composer who had given
his greatest efforts to the development of instrumental music. “The
Seasons” was first performed in Vienna in 1801. It proved as successful
as “The Creation.” Haydn’s simple, genial nature is apparent in this
beautiful work, really too light to bear the name of oratorio, which
has such close association with works of a deep, religious character.</p>
<p><b>Mozart and Beethoven</b>.—As the orchestra developed under the
masters of tone and dramatic effects, Mozart, Gluck and Beethoven,
so the works in oratorio form took on a different texture. In the
earlier periods, the accompaniments were subordinate, the interest was
centred in the voices. But as composers realized the possibilities
of the constantly-improving orchestra and the opportunities for
effective combinations of voices and instruments, the tendency
became more and more marked to elaborate the instrumental parts and
to create an ensemble more complicated and gorgeous, based upon the
orchestra and its tone-color scheme rather than on pure vocal effects.
<b>Mozart’s</b> “Requiem” (1791), written just before the composer’s
death, brings into use the most powerful dramatic resources of
orchestra and voices to portray the spirit of the “mass for the dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>”
In oratorio, as in opera, <b>Beethoven</b> wrote but one work, “The
Mount of Olives” (1803). The style is florid and operatic, somewhat
in the style of the Italian composers; the resources of the orchestra
are drawn upon more extensively than marked the methods of Haydn. The
chorus is freely used, the “Hallelujah” being the strongest movement.
The choral movements in the Ninth Symphony suggest what Beethoven
might have done had he set himself to writing an oratorio in greater
submission to the capacity of the human voice.</p>
<p><b>Spohr</b>.—From now on, oratorio composition is associated with
the masters of instrumental music, the orchestra is drawn upon for
its richest and most powerful resources to work out the emotional
and dramatic qualities of the texts; it is now no longer a mere
accompanying instrument; it is in the highest degree essential to the
effects designed by the composer. <b>Ludwig Spohr</b> (1784-1859), a
great violinist, wrote his first oratorio, “<i>Das Jüngste Gericht</i>”
(The Last Judgment), when he was but twenty-eight years old. A later
work produced in 1826, goes by the English name “The Last Judgment,”
although that is not the literal translation of the German title <i>Die
Letzten Dinge</i>. In this work we find the romantic idea clearly in
evidence. The composer’s style had been developed and individualized
by his long experience as player and conductor; he was a master of the
resources of instrumentation, conversant both as composer and conductor
with the limitations of voices—he wrote a number of operas—so that
he was prepared for the creation of a work which has a character of
its own. A striking feature of this oratorio is the frequent use of
chromatic progressions, which is indeed a characteristic of Spohr’s writing.</p>
<p><b>Mendelssohn</b>.—The next great composer in Oratorio was a German;
like him also his works had their greatest reception in England,
<b>Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy</b> (1809-1847). His first work, “St.
Paul,” was given at Düsseldorf in 1836. His greatest oratorio, one that
ranks with Handel’s “Messiah” in public favor, is “Elijah,” which was
written for the Birmingham, England, Festival. It was first produced in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
1846. As a diligent and enthusiastic student of Bach, it seems natural
that Mendelssohn should have adopted the great master’s methods. In
style “St. Paul” and “Elijah” show leanings toward Bach and the German
oratorio rather than toward Handel. Mendelssohn, who produced Bach’s
“Passion according to St. Matthew” in Berlin, in 1827, was thoroughly
familiar with the plan of the German oratorio, a mingling of narrative,
dramatic and meditative or reflective elements, and especially the
Chorale to represent the Church, the chorus being, properly speaking,
a part of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, representing masses of people who
share in the action, while the congregation represents the reflective
element. He uses a fugal style quite freely in his choruses, but a
strict fugue, in the style of Handel, is rare, as the composer’s
feeling for emotional effects demands a freer style; the accompaniments
are elaborate, partaking of the dramatic element and drawing upon
the fullest resources of the orchestra. Mendelssohn had started the
composition of another oratorio, “Christus,” on the lines of the
“Passion” music of Bach, but died before the work was completed. His
“Hymn of Praise” (1840), a large choral work that is occasionally sung,
well represents Mendelssohn’s skill in combining vocal and orchestral
effect. Riemann calls it a symphony-cantata, Parry says it “combines
the qualities of a symphony and of an oratorio.”</p>

<h2>LESSON XXV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Evolution of the Pianoforte</span></span>.</h2>
<p>While the violin, on account of the simplicity of its construction,
arrived early at a stage of perfection, the complicated mechanism of
the pianoforte required many generations and many scores of more or
less successful experiments to attain anything like a corresponding
plane. Indeed, such experiments are still constantly in progress; so
that the pianoforte of the future may conceivably realize possibilities
as far ahead of the present piano as that is ahead of its predecessors.
The first attempts at piano manufacture, however, had little in common
with our modern pianos, save the principle of the combination of the
keyboard with strings; since in construction and resulting tone few
points of similarity exist.</p>
<p><b>Clavier a Substitute for the Organ</b>.—We are probably indebted
to the extensive use of the organ for the earliest combinations of
keys and strings. As the demand arose for a more conveniently-keyed
instrument than the large church organs, for practice or private
houses, small portable organs were invented; yet even these did not
satisfy the want entirely, owing to the <i>difficulties in their wind
supply</i>, which required an assistant as blower. Thus the organ keyboard
came to be applied, as early as the 11th century, to already existing
stringed instruments which were adapted to the purpose.</p>
<p class="space-below3"><b>Two Classes</b>.—There were two classes of these,
each made on the principle of the zither: namely, by stretching strings over
a flat surface or box, generally across bridges, this box serving as
a resonator, to reinforce the weak tone of the strings. One such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
instrument, in which the strings were <i>struck by</i> little wooden
<i>hammers</i>, was called the Dulcimer; another, in which the strings were
sounded by <i>plucking</i> with the fingers or by a quill, was called the
Psaltery; and from these two were developed the earliest instruments
of the piano class, called by the general name of “Claviers,” from
<i>Clavis</i>, a key. The dulcimer type resulted in the <b>Clavichord</b>;
the psaltery type in the <b>Harpsichord</b>, and, although many other
names were given to varieties of these instruments, all may be placed
in one of the two classes of which they are the chief representatives.</p>

</div>
<p class="no-indent"><br><br>This instrument<br>also came in square<br>and other forms;<br>strings varied<br>from 6 to 38.</p>
<hr class="r5">
<p><b>Principle of the Clavichord</b>.—The first of the Clavichord
instruments had the name of Monochord, or one-stringed instrument—a
name of great antiquity, first given by the Grecian Pythagoras to an
instrument of one string used by him in determining the relations of
tones. Similar experiments were made in the Middle Ages, in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
various tones resulting from the vibrations of parts of a string were
studied by means of movable bridges; facility was gained by increasing
the number of strings to four or five, tuned in unison. Next, <i>keys</i>
were applied to these in place of the bridges, which keys <i>struck the
strings at various</i> definite <i>points</i> by means of upright pins or
<i>tangents</i>, as they were called, producing varying pitches, according
to the length of the part of the string allowed to sound, the remaining
segment being silenced by a piece of cloth. Thus several tangents
struck the same string at different points, producing different
degrees of pitch. At first, when only the scales corresponding to
the white keys were employed, four or five strings sufficed to sound
the necessary tones, not over twenty-two in number. Later, however,
when chromatic notes were adopted, the number of strings and keys
was increased, so that, by the beginning of the 16th century, the
keyboard had a range of three or four full octaves. From this time
on, this instrument, now generally known as the Clavichord, won a
popularity which extended to the beginning of the 19th century, when
the Pianoforte gradually displaced it. A familiar instrument in England
and Germany, it was especially cultivated by musicians of note in the
latter country, even the renowned Bach preferring it to all other forms
of its class.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>The Clavichord</b>.—In shape, the Clavichord was an
oblong box, the strings of brass extending lengthwise. The fact that one string
served for several keys made it impossible to sound certain intervals
together; yet the device of giving a separate string to each key seems
not to have come in till about the year 1725, and even then not to have
been generally adopted. Without legs, the Clavichord was supported
on a table when in use. Its tone was exceedingly weak and tremulous,
audible only within the distance of a few feet; yet the fact that
this tone could be given different degrees of intensity, and could be
varied to some extent even while sounding, by a peculiar pressure on
the keys (<i>bebung</i>), imbued its tone with a sympathetic quality which
helps to account for the tenacity with which musicians clung to it,
notwithstanding all its imperfections.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="294" src="images/image239.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image239.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">The Clavichord</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Principle of the Harpsichord</b>.—Instruments of the Harpsichord
class were especially numerous in Italy, France and England. They
differed from the Clavichord chiefly in the method of setting the
string in vibration. This was done by <i>plucking</i> the string with a
quill set in a jack at the end of the key, the action so arranged that,
after the key was released, the jack fell back to its place, while
a damper came against the string, preventing its further vibration.
Since these strings could not be used as bridges, like the tangents of
the Clavichord, it was necessary from the first that each key should
have a separate string. Moreover, as these strings were thus made of
varying lengths and thicknesses, the Harpsichords were more often made
in a triangular shape, or one like our modern grand pianos, than in
the rectangular Clavichord shape. The chief defect, and the one which
makers tried in vain to remedy, lay in the fact that the <i>plucking</i>
of the strings, while producing greater brilliancy, <i>admitted</i> of <i>no
variation</i> in its degrees of <i>loudness</i> or <i>softness</i>.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Virginal and Spinet</b>.—Several small instruments of
this kind preceded its full development, differing mainly in shape and choice of
materials. In England these received the name of Virginal; in France,
that of Spinet. Both of these were introduced into polite society,
chiefly as small house instruments of limited compass, varied sizes,
and frequently with elaborate decoration. The difference between them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
was principally one of shape, the Virginal taking the oblong form
of the Clavichord, while the Spinet was more often triangular. They
appeared both with and without supports; and in some cases the strings
were placed in a vertical position, as in our upright pianofortes.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">The Virginal or Spinet</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Harpsichord</b>.—The Harpsichord proper was simply a larger
form of the Spinet and Virginal, and was made in the form of the
grand pianoforte. On account of its added brilliancy of tone, it
was admirably adapted for use in the orchestra, in which it became
the conductor’s instrument in connection with the opera. In Italy,
the terms Clavicembalo and Gravicembalo were given to it, while in
Germany it was called Flügel, or wing, from its wing-shaped cover.
As it became popular as a concert instrument, many inventions were
added to increase the brilliancy and variety of its tone: an extra
keyboard was placed above the first, as in the organ, and three or four
strings were given each note, which could be used to reinforce the
single-string tone, by means of the second keyboard. Moreover, various
kinds of quills were invented, giving different tone qualities; and
such effects were controlled by stops or pedals. These experiments were
especially numerous in the 18th century, in which the rapid growth of
musical resources demanded constantly more tonal possibilities. Large
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
manufacturers, such as the Ruckers family of Antwerp, and Tabel in
England, vied with each other in producing novel devices, such as the
imitation of other instruments, the tuning of an extra string for each
note an octave above its normal pitch, and the addition of a keyboard
connected with an organ. Attempts to produce a sustained tone resulted
in the Piano-Violin, in which a revolving rosined wheel was pressed by
the key against the string, to continue the tone; but all such were
abandoned finally as unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">Two-Manual Harpsichord</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Invention of the Pianoforte</b>.—To this exceptional activity in
keyed instruments, and the final failure to produce a singing tone
capable of variation in the Harpsichord, we owe the invention of the
Pianoforte. In 1711, <b>Bartolomeo Cristofori</b>, a noted harpsichord
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
maker of Tuscany, exhibited several “forte-pianos” in which the
action was so constructed that the keys, when depressed, threw little
<i>leather-headed hammers</i>, affixed to a bar above them, <i>against the
strings</i>, thus making it possible to modulate the strength of tone by
the degree of force with which the keys were struck. When the key was
released, a <i>damper</i> came against the string from beneath, <i>stopping
further vibration</i>.</p>
<p><b>Early Makers</b>.—Although this invention did not at first attract
widespread attention, it undoubtedly formed the basis of the others
which quickly followed it, and really asserted the principle afterwards
adopted for the piano action. In 1716, <b>Marius</b>, a French
manufacturer, submitted four models for piano actions, which, however,
were never developed. Also, <b>Schroeter</b>, a German, constructed two
models of piano actions, in 1717, in one of which the hammers struck
on top of the strings; but neither of these was put to practical use.
Finally, <b>Gottfried Silbermann</b>, of Saxony, distinguished as an
organ and harpsichord maker, made two pianofortes, the action of which
was evidently based on that of Cristofori, and which he exhibited to
J. S. Bach. While praising them in many respects, Bach criticised
them as too weak in the upper notes, and too hard to play. Silbermann
was exceedingly painstaking as a workman, having the reputation of
breaking to pieces with an axe even a finished product which showed
any imperfection. He therefore set to work to remedy these defects,
and, in 1737, produced several pianofortes which won Bach’s unqualified approval.</p>
<p><b>Superiority of the Piano</b>.—The Pianoforte was now placed upon a
firm basis; and although many years elapsed before its resources were
developed sufficiently to cause its universal adoption by musicians,
the final victory over its predecessors was complete. And this victory
was natural, since the Pianoforte was found capable of combining the
best qualities of the Clavichord and the Harpsichord, with the addition
of a tone capacity infinitely superior to either.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Improvements</b>.—The story of succeeding piano manufacture and the
manifold inventions and improvements relative to it is one of infinite
details. Among these we notice that while Silbermann pianos were in
“grand” form, <b>Frederici</b> of Gera (died 1779) constructed them
in oblong or “square” shape; that the pianos of Spaeth (died 1796)
and of <b>J. Andreas Stein</b> (died 1792), whose pianos were adopted
for use by Mozart, showed considerable advancement. The Stein family
became allied with <b>Andreas Streicher</b>, an inventive genius, and
founded a manufactory in Vienna which has maintained a high standard to
the present time. The action invented by them, known as the Viennese
action, differs from that of Cristofori in having the hammers annexed
to the keys themselves, instead of on a bar above them; thus giving
a light touch and tone. In England, the principle of the Cristofori
action was developed by the renowned house of <b>Broadwood</b>,
their action becoming known as the English action; while in France,
<b>Sebastian Erhard</b>, or <b>Erard</b>, a Strasburg inventor, founded
the Erard action, which has a double hammer movement, allowing the
hammers to fall either entirely, or only partially into place after
the key is struck, at the will of the performer. The “cottage” action,
introduced by <b>William Southwell</b>, about 1800, was the beginning
of the “upright” form, which has now entirely superseded that of the
square piano. Thus, by continued experiments, the piano has gained in
compass, brilliancy, sustaining power and strength of construction,
to meet the constantly-increasing demands placed upon it, until the
modern piano seems to possess unlimited resources, and until the
unending supply of instruments of all grades from hundreds of factories
is sufficient to place one of these “household orchestras” within the
reach of rich and poor alike.</p>
<p><b>Equal Temperament</b>.—An early difficulty in the case of keyed
instruments was the matter of tuning, caused by the fact that it was
found scientifically impossible to tune all the intervals of the scale
at the same time to the true pitch; that is, the pitch demanded by the
natural overtones of the fundamental note of the scale. At the outset,
for instance, it was found that if the fifths were tuned true, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
octaves would be a trifle sharp; and, conversely, if the octaves were
true, the fifths would be a trifle flat. In the case of stringed
instruments, where the tone was made by the performer, it could be
so modified as not to conflict seriously; but with keyed instruments
this was impossible. Thus, many systems of tuning or “temperaments”
were tried, such as having two keys for two notes nearly in unison,
like F-sharp and G-flat, most of these resulting in the possibility of
playing in a few nearly related keys, to the exclusion of the others.
Finally, through the influence of <b>J. S. Bach</b> (1685-1750) and
the Frenchman <b>Rameau</b> (1683-1764), the simple expedient was
definitely adopted of tuning the octaves true, and dividing each
octave into twelve equal parts, thus uniting such notes as F-sharp and
G-flat in one tone slightly out of tune with either, but not enough
seriously to offend the ear. This, called “<i>equal temperament</i>,” was
a great gain to music, since it not only removed a radical defect in
keyed instruments, but also opened the door to that free interchange of
keys which has done so much toward enriching the coloring and scope of
succeeding compositions.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Early Italian Clavier Composers</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Early Instrumental Music</b>.—The history of pianoforte composition
and playing really begins with that of the preceding keyed instruments
with strings, to all of which the convenient name of “Claviers” will
be given. As these early instruments were at first merely substitutes
for the organ, which in turn was used simply to reduplicate voice
parts, the music first played on them was in no wise different from the
vocal and organ music of the day. When, moreover, music written for
the organ had some features distinct from purely vocal music, it was
frequently inscribed to be <i>played on the organ or clavier</i>, without
discrimination.</p>
<p><b>Influence of the Renaissance</b>.—As most of the patterns of
musical form have proceeded from Italy, so it was there, in Venice,
that instrumental music seems to have emerged from its union with
vocal music, and to have assumed the elements of a style of its own.
This was directly the result of the general awakening of thought
after the Dark Ages, known as the Renaissance, which, leading to
independent investigation in the domains of science and art, brought
in the once unheard-of inventions and the discovery of new worlds, and
in the other a freedom of treatment fitted to express the new ideas
surging throughout the civilized world. Thus, in the first part of
the 16th century, while Raphael and Michael Angelo were voicing these
thoughts in their immortal creations, in Venice, a school of musicians
was turning its attention toward instrumental music, and striving
to produce in music a richness of color, just as the great Venetian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
painters, like Titian and Giorgione, were producing similar effects
upon canvas. Teachers and students were congregating there,
enthusiastic over the new ideas in music; and the focal point of all
this activity was the Church of St. Mark’s, whose magnificent double
organ furnished an incentive to genius.</p>
<p><b>The First Sonata</b>.—Among these musicians were a number of
apostles of the Netherlands school, of whom <b>Adrian Willaert</b>
(1480-1562) was especially honored and beloved. He and his successors,
as organists at St. Mark’s, wrote compositions for organ or clavier,
which they taught to young ladies in the convents. Such compositions
were made the more possible by the fact that into the old Church
Modes, formed by using only the tones represented by the white keys
of our piano, “chromatic” or <i>colored</i> tones came to be inserted;
so that, in the course of the 16th century, the modern scales, with
their characteristic keynotes, or tonalities, came to vie with the old
modes, and ultimately nearly to displace them, thus giving a chance
for a variety and grouping of harmonies necessary in the elaboration
of instrumental music. The name Sonata, or “sound” piece, was at first
given indiscriminately to such instrumental works, in distinction from
the Cantata, or vocal work.</p>
<p><b>Willaert and His Pupils</b>.—Willaert was especially successful
as a teacher, and thus left a number of accomplished pupils to carry
on his labors. Of these, <b>Girolamo Parabosco</b> (1593-1609) was
noted for his free fantasias, and his improvisations of sonatas on
the harpsichord; while <b>Claudio Merulo</b> of Correggio (1533-1604)
wrote a number of toccatas, in which the old church chorale style
was relieved by contrasting passages consisting of brilliant runs.
The Toccata, or <i>touch</i> piece, had, as its characteristics, such
<i>quick running passages</i>, probably first suggested by the light tone
and action of the Clavier. While these runs had at first very little
relevancy to one another, they were much delighted in by these early
pioneers, who sported with them as a child plays with a new toy.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Gabrieli’s</b>.—Two other organists of St. Mark’s, <b>Andreas
Gabrieli</b> (1510-1586), and his nephew and pupil, <b>Giovanni
Gabrieli</b> (1557-1613), added to the resources of instrumental music.
The first of these, a pupil of Willaert, himself became a famous
teacher; and both contributed many canzone and sonatas to organ and
clavier literature. In all these the subjects were distinct, and, in
the canzone especially, the many quick passages and changing rhythms
were used in a manner that contributed to unity.</p>
<p><b>The Harpsichord in Opera</b>.—A new factor now appeared in
Florence, destined greatly to further the cause of clavier music:
namely, the Opera. Taking the position of the conductor’s instrument,
the harpsichord became the most useful member of the orchestra, and was
employed constantly to fill in vague harmonies, and to strike chords as
a support to the musical declamation of the singers. Such chords were
not generally written out, but were suggested by their bass note, over
which figures were written to show their positions. To this shorthand
system the name of Thorough-bass was given. In this way the value of
chord combinations came to be recognized, and the relationships of such
chords studied entirely apart from the voice writing; so the idea of a
single melody, supported by occasional chords, was transplanted from
the Opera, and the modern harmonic style of music came into being.</p>
<p><b>Dance Tunes</b>.—But, in this new style, the old basis for Unity
in the composition, furnished by the imitation of one part by another,
had to be abandoned, since only one melodic part existed at a time;
hence a new <i>basis</i> had to be found in the manner in which <i>harmonies
succeeded</i> each other. In determining such chord relationships,
composers were obliged to look elsewhere than to the old Church music;
and so turned their attention to the forms of Dance Tunes which
had already been in use for a long time among the people in their
Folk-songs, and in the performances of the wandering minstrels. Most
of these dance tunes were formed in a very simple <i>two-part</i> design
of harmony, consisting in a transition from the initial key to a
contrasting key, for the first part, and a return from the contrasting
key to the first key, in the second part.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Origin of the Suite</b>.—A book of such dances, based, however, on
the clumsy church modes, was published in 1551. Later, however, such
dances came to be written in the new harmonic style; and by putting
together a set of dances all in the same key but differing in rhythm
and mode of expression, a larger form of composition was devised,
combining Variety with Unity. To this form the name of Suite was given.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="504" src="images/image249.jpg" width="400" id="img_images_image249.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">Girolamo Frescobaldi</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Frescobaldi</b>.—Another element tending to give Unity to the
composition was developed when composers learned to work out a <i>single
subject</i>, or melodic phrase representing a definite musical idea, by
introducing it a number of times in the course of the composition,
sometimes with slight variation, but always recognizable and used in
such a way as to bind the various parts the more closely together by
their similarity of conception. Several organists at Rome wrote music
which possessed such unity of idea. One of these was <b>Girolamo
Frescobaldi</b> (1583-1644), a man who was a close student of the best
Italian music of his time, and who had, moreover, been brought into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
contact with Netherlands ideas through travel in Belgium. On his first
appearance as organist of St. Peter’s in Rome, in 1615, so great fame
had preceded him that over 30,000 people are said to have attended the
performance. His skill on the clavier was no less than that on the
organ; and for both of these instruments he wrote Ricercari, Canzone
and Capricci, which showed considerable unity of subject, together
with fluency in the treatment of chromatic progressions, and a wealth
of invention, which displayed itself in novel themes and unusual
harmonies; his compositions are well worth study.</p>
<p><b>Pasquini</b>.—In the second half of the 17th century, <b>Bernardo
Pasquini</b> (1637-1710), a pupil of the opera composer Cesti, carried
on the work at Rome. In his toccati he shows great freedom in departing
from the strict vocal style, and his clavier works have features, like
the sustained trill, which distinguish them decidedly from organ works.</p>
<p><b>Method of Playing the Clavier</b>.—The method of playing the
clavier used by these old masters was peculiar. In a work on the
subject published by Di Ruta, about the year 1600, the rules given
include holding the fingers out <i>flat</i> on the keys, and scarcely using
the thumb at all, allowing it to hang below the level of the keyboard.
The scales were played each with <i>two</i> fingers, according to fixed
rules; so that smoothness combined with rapidity seems to have been
made impossible.</p>
<p><b>The Sonata and Overture</b>.—Starting with the harmonic form of
the old dance tunes, composers now began to elaborate this to a form
capable of expressing more serious ideas, by giving more definiteness
to the musical subject treated, and by introducing material derived
from the old vocal forms. <b>Corelli</b>, the violinist (1653-1713),
and the violinists of his school, restricted the name Sonata to
combinations of such movements, in distinction from the lighter
forms of the Suite; and the celebrated opera composer, <b>Alessandro
Scarlatti</b> (1659-1725), applied similar methods to the composition
of his operatic overtures, writing them in three parts: first, a
moderately fast movement, which was followed by a slow movement, the
whole closing with a movement in quick tempo.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Domenico Scarlatti</b>.—Clavier music lagged somewhat behind violin
music, owing to the greater perfection of the violin as an instrument,
and also to the popularity of the lute, which was much affected in
fashionable circles. Finally, however, a man appeared who possessed
the genius to develop the peculiar resources of the harpsichord to
a remarkable extent. This was <b>Domenico Scarlatti</b>, the son
and pupil of Alessandro Scarlatti. The latter was himself a skilful
clavier player and composer; but his son attained a proficiency so far
eclipsing that of any of his predecessors as to place him entirely
without the pale of comparison with any of them. Domenico Scarlatti,
who was born at Naples in 1683, two years before Handel and Bach,
first attracted attention when about twenty-one years old, as an
opera composer; but achieved his greatest successes as a virtuoso on
the harpsichord, winning a world-wide reputation for his wonderful
playing, which was a revelation of what could be done with this
hitherto undeveloped instrument. In one of Handel’s Italian journeys a
contest of skill was instituted between these two musical giants; and
the result was a drawn battle so far as the harpsichord was concerned,
although Handel triumphed at the organ. Scarlatti traveled about
somewhat, spending most of his later life in the position of court
music master at Madrid. He finally returned to his birthplace, where he
died in 1757.</p>
<p><b>Scarlatti’s Use of Form</b>.—In the matter of form, Scarlatti
developed still further the work of his predecessors, applying to
the harpsichord the principles asserted by Corelli and his school.
His Sonatas were written in <i>one movement</i> only, and have very
<i>definite subjects</i>, which are carried out along recognized lines. His
Capriccii—short pieces written in a rhythmic and delicately staccato
style—are some of his best works, and undoubtedly paved the way for
the Scherzi, written by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. His compositions are
short, but concise and definite.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Scarlatti’s Style of Playing</b>.—But his chief addition to musical
material lies in the new style of playing which he invented. Novel
effects, like crossing the hands, long leaps, broken chords in contrary
motion, rapidly repeated notes, and runs in thirds and sixths—effects
which were in many cases far ahead of his time, since they were not
used by succeeding composers until a much later period—were employed
by him with the utmost fluency, so that he has been aptly called the
father of modern pianoforte technic.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Examples of Scarlatti’s Style</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Durante</b>.—The Neapolitan school boasted several other
worthy clavier composers, who contributed in various ways to the composition
of the Sonata. One of these was <b>Francesco Durante</b> (1684-1755),
who wrote sonatas in two movements of different character but in the
same key. The first, called a Studio, was written as a free fugue with
running passages; the second, or Divertimento, was more animated and
less scholastic. <b>Domenico Alberti</b> (1707-1740) composed sonatas
similar in general form, but of less artistic worth, consisting as
they did simply of a single-voiced melody, supported by an harmonic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
accompaniment having no independence of style. Much of this was in the
form of broken chords, a mannerism which was afterwards used to excess,
and became dubbed the “Alberti bass.” This accompaniment form doubtless
suited the clavichord and harpsichord, but is not so well adapted to
the more sonorous modern piano. It is still used by composers for very
simple accompaniments.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Pier Domenico Paradies</b> (1710-1792) deserves special mention
as the writer of elegant and well-balanced clavier music. He first
won success as a composer of operas, which were given in Italy, and
afterwards in London, where he finally settled as clavier teacher.
His sonatas have two movements, like Durante’s, and contain brilliant
allegros, besides attractive melodies. His two-part rapid contrapuntal
work is excellent, both for musical merit and for technical study.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>.—We have seen, then, that in the 16th century, in
Italy, instrumental music began to break from its union with vocal
music; that the Opera brought the harpsichord especially into notice in
the 17th century, on account of its availability for accompaniments,
and that finally, in the 18th century, the Neapolitan composers
developed for it a style which took advantage of its peculiar
resources, and applied them to the enrichment of the harmonic forms
which were coming into vogue.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Early English and French Clavier Schools</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>English Schools to Henry VIII</b>.—Popular music, both vocal and
instrumental, was an early English institution. The many Folk-songs
which have come down from a very early period bear witness to the
English love of conviviality. Dance tunes, sometimes based on these
Folk-songs, were played on the instruments of the minstrels, which,
as early as 1484, included the clavichord; and the fact that such
instruments were cultivated by people of higher rank is shown by the
record that James IV of Scotland and his queen purchased clavichords
to play upon, in 1503, while the queen of Henry VII of England bought
a clavichord for her private use in 1502. The virginal is spoken of
in the reign of Henry VII; Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547), who was an
accomplished musician, played upon both these instruments, and also
wrote music for them.</p>
<p><b>To Queen Elizabeth’s Time</b>.—Edward VI (r. 1547-1553) had three
duly appointed virginal players among his court musicians; and after
Elizabeth (r. 1558-1603) ascended the throne, the virginal increased in
popularity; indeed, its name was formerly thought to have been derived
from her as the virgin queen; although the fact that the instrument was
spoken of as the virginal before her reign makes its derivation from
its popularity among young ladies the more probable. Queen Elizabeth,
as well as her sister Mary, received instruction in virginal playing
during her early youth, and became an accomplished performer; and
instances are shown of the former’s great pride in this accomplishment.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
In the course of her illustrious reign, when all the arts flourished
to a remarkable degree, and when great wits and litterateurs vied
with each other in the genius of their productions, the art of music
received its share of attention also. The fact that musical degrees
were early given at the great universities, Oxford and Cambridge,
tended to raise the standard of musical knowledge, and to produce a
number of composers who were especially gifted in the more serious
Church forms of writing. Many such, connected with the Royal Chapel and
the court, wrote excellent anthems and secular part-songs; and now,
attracted by the popularity of the instrument, they began to give a
more worthy setting to the folk and dance tunes played on the clavier.</p>
<p><b>Dance Tunes</b>.—A clavier composition is extant, dated 1555, by
<b>William Blitheman</b>, an English church composer, consisting of
a chorale-like melody in whole notes, accompanied first by a flowing
eighth-note figure, and next by triplet quarter notes, with a third
voice added later. Such a serious style prefigured the variations upon
dance tunes, which were especially cultivated by <b>William Byrd</b>
(1538-1623). In such variations the melody was first harmonized in
simple fashion, and was afterwards played several times in the same
part, with slight changes, while the accompanying parts were varied
in rhythm and style, becoming generally quicker in tempo. To modern
ears the result is monotonous, as the same key and time signature is
maintained throughout; but the variety in presentation must have been
grateful after the simplicity of the dance tunes.</p>
<p><b>The Virginal Book</b>.—Other popular forms were the Fancie, in
which several melodic subjects were imitated in the various voices;
and the Pavane, a dance in common time, whose theme was repeated in
the following Galliarde, a dance in triple time. These and other forms
are used in a curious collection of clavier pieces now preserved
at Cambridge, and known as Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book. This
collection, consisting of four hundred and eighteen manuscript pages,
written on a six-lined staff, contains seventy compositions by Byrd,
besides others by most of the composers of the Elizabethan era, like
Tallis, Dr. Bull, Giles, Farnaby and many others.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p class="space-below1"><b>Leading Elizabethan Composers</b>.—Byrd
was a pupil of <b>Thomas Tallis</b> (d. 1585), the renowned church
composer, and together they were made organists of Queen Elizabeth’s
Chapel, in 1575, receiving also the sole right to print music.
Another musician who deserves special mention is <b>Dr. John Bull</b>
(1563-1628), who won world-wide fame as organist and clavier player,
finally becoming organist at Antwerp Cathedral, which post he held
until his death. His clavier compositions show great technical fluency.
<b>Orlando Gibbons</b> (1583-1625), a Doctor of Music at Oxford, and
organist at Westminster Abbey, wrote excellently in the prevailing
style. Shakespeare testifies to the popularity of clavier playing at
this time in one of his sonnets, where he speaks of the keys as</p>
<p class="center space-below1">“O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">Although these early English composers wrote
with musical solidity, their compositions can scarcely be said to
have added much to the development of the instrumental style, or to
clavier technic; and, in fact, they amounted to little more than a
side issue in music, withdrawn from the general advancement, and
valuable chiefly as curiosities. The melodies were apt to be wearisome,
through monotonous repetitions, the rhythms to lack variety, and the
modulations to appear chiefly in the form of unsuccessful attempts.</p>
<p><b>The Parthenia</b>.—During the first half of the 17th century
the virginal retained its popularity, although political turmoils
prevented much positive advancement in music. The “Parthenia,” a volume
containing the first printed collection of virginal music, appeared in
1611, composed of twenty-one pieces by Byrd, Bull and Gibbons; and a
similar volume followed, with compositions for virginal and bass viol,
by Robert Hole.</p>
<p><b>Purcell</b>.—In the reign of Charles II (1660-1685) music again
came to the fore, and was ably promoted by <b>Henry Purcell</b>, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
was born in the year when Cromwell died, 1658, and died in 1695.
Purcell is a shining figure in English musical history, through his
ability as an opera composer, in which capacity he produced bright and
pithy works, thoroughly English in spirit, and healthy in tone. He
published a volume of twelve clavier sonatas in 1683, with parts also
for two violins and a bass viol, founded on the model of the Italian
violin sonatas, each having an Adagio, a Canzona, a slow movement and
an Air. Later he published other sonatas, besides suites and separate
pieces for the clavier. Upon the advent of Handel, however, the English
composers became, for the most part, mere imitators of his style, which
had so caught the national ear as to well-nigh eclipse all other kinds
of music. The early English school, therefore, can be said to have had
its last exponent in the person of Purcell.</p>
<p><b>Rise of the French School</b>.—In France a school of clavier
compositions developed during the brilliant reign of Louis XIV
(1643-1715), which did much toward imparting elegance and polish,
besides characteristic rhythms and technical figures, to clavier
music. The head of this school and the personal teacher of many
succeeding clavier composers and players was <b>Andre Champion de
Chambonnières</b> (d. 1670), who became court clavier player to the
king. He is said to have been master of a full tone on the harpsichord
attained by none other than himself; he also published two books
of clavier compositions, written in the pure harmonic style, and
showing the tendency toward brilliant embellishments which became
a characteristic of his successors. Of his pupils, <b>Jean Henry
d’Anglebert</b> (d. 1691), was clavier player at court, and published
in 1689 a book containing clavier arrangements of airs and dances from
the operas of Lully, with rules for their execution.</p>
<p><b>The Couperin Family</b>.—Two, at least, of the famous musical
family of Couperin also came under the instruction of Champion. These
were <b>Louis Couperin</b> (1630-1665), and <b>François Couperin</b>
(1631-1701), who, with their brother <b>Charles Couperin</b>
(1638-1669), and his son <b>François Couperin</b>, called “le Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>”
(1668-1733), were all at various times organists of the church of St.
Gervais, at Paris. The Couperins may be considered as classic composers
for the clavier, as their style, though having an harmonic basis, was
mostly in the line of instrumental voice writing. The first-named
published three suites of dances for clavier; and the second was
eminently popular as a teacher.</p>
<p><b>François Couperin</b>.—François Couperin, “le Grand,” deserves
special attention, and has been called the <i>first great composer</i>
distinctively <i>for the clavier</i>. He was a pupil of the organist
Thomelin, and rose quickly to so commanding a position as player of
the organ and clavier that, in 1701, he was appointed court clavier
player and organist at the Royal Chapel. He was very accurate as a
composer; and in the four books of clavier pieces which he published
successively, he gave minute directions for interpreting the wealth
of ornamentation with which his melodies are surrounded. Most of
these pieces are <i>written in two voices</i>, with the upper melody
most prominent; and they reflect the artificial show and glitter of
the French court in their endless <i>turns</i> and <i>embellishments</i>. Yet
for this very reason they have amplified the resources of clavier
compositions, preparing the way for composers like Scarlatti, Bach and
Handel. Many of them show the French taste toward attaching definite
meaning to music, by their fanciful titles, like “La tendre Nanette,”
“La Flatteuse”—a custom followed by others of this school. Couperin
wrote also a treatise on clavier touch, and was <i>one of the first to
make use of the thumb in playing</i>.</p>
<p><b>Louis Marchand</b> (1669-1732) was a brilliant though dissipated
figure in clavier playing. Becoming organist at the court of
Versailles, he lost the post through his reckless habits, and, going
to Dresden, he was somewhat subdued in his conceit by the evident
superiority of Bach. On his return to Paris, he became exceedingly
popular as a teacher, although his extravagant style of living
brought him finally to poverty. His pupil, <b>Louis Claude Daquin</b>
(1694-1772), received through him an appointment as organist at the
church of St. Paul, in preference to Rameau, of whose superiority
Marchand became jealous. Daquin published a number of rather superficial clavier pieces.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">Jean-Phillippe Rameau</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Jean-Phillippe Rameau</b>, the last and greatest light of this
school, has even greater fame as an opera composer. He was born at
Dijon in 1683, and displayed so great musical talent when a mere child
that, although his parents had intended him for another profession,
he was finally sent to Italy to study music. After spending some time
there, he joined the orchestra of an opera troupe, traveling about
France and gaining an insight into dramatic composition. Upon going to
Paris he studied with Marchand, who recognized and feared his talent,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and who finally was the means of his leaving Paris. Later, however,
he obtained an organ position outside of Paris, and soon attracted
attention not only by his playing, but also by the publication, in
1726, of a treatise on Harmony. In this he <i>reduced</i> the study of
<i>chords</i> to a <i>scientific foundation</i>, and won his title of the name of
creator of the modern science of Harmony. Returning to Paris, he now
secured an organ position there, and set to work upon the series of
dramatic productions which made him the foremost opera composer of his
day, superior even to the popular Lully. In 1737, he published another
theoretical work, in which the principles of Equal Temperament, which
J. S. Bach had adopted fifteen years before, were so clearly stated as
to make their establishment permanent for future composers. Rameau’s
theories were the subject of much controversy in his day; but many
distinguished contemporaries, like Rousseau and Voltaire, were his warm
partisans. He died in 1764.</p>
<p><b>Rameau’s Clavier Works</b>.—His numerous <i>clavier compositions</i>
show great advance in freedom of expression, and are written mostly
in <i>three parts</i>, with an occasional succession of full chords. Many
of these have <i>descriptive titles</i>, such as “La Poule,” in which the
cackling of a hen is cleverly imitated. Others are in the form of dance
suites. The order of Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue was
made the basis of these suites as well as those of Couperin, although
this order admitted of considerable variation; and no other principle
of Unity appears in them, with the exception of a <i>common key</i>.</p>
<p><b>End of the Early French School</b>.—The growing importance of the
German school now came to be felt in France so strongly that the French
school came to lose its individuality. We therefore turn our attention
to the important developments in instrumental music which were effected in Germany.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The German Polyphonic Clavier School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>German Mastery of Polyphonic Music</b>.—The Italians, with their
quick perception of structural beauty, have been the pioneers in the
invention and use of most art forms. So it happened, in the history
of instrumental music, that they were the ones to invent and give to
other nations the vehicle of expression, while it remained for their
pupils, notably, in this case, the composers of Germany, to fill these
forms out with the expression of real and deep feeling. The German
tendency toward serious and philosophical thought found the intricacies
of polyphonic music, or the simultaneous flow of independent melodies,
admirably adapted to their need of expression; and when this style
of voice writing was applied to instrumental compositions, German
musicians found a branch of art in which they were admirably qualified
to excel. So, from being mere pupils of the Italians, they advanced
to the production of works of much more distinguished character and
deeper, richer content than was possible to mere beauty of form and melody.</p>
<p><b>Hasler</b>.—In the second half of the 16th century, the clavier
was popular in Germany, disputing the place of the lute as a social
instrument, although organ and clavier compositions were identical, as
in Italy. There is a record of the publication of two books of pieces
for organ and “instrument”—by which is meant the clavier—in 1575-77,
in which there were dance tunes with accompanying chords. <b>Hans Leo
Hasler</b> (1564-1612), a pupil of A. Gabrieli, and fellow-student with
G. Gabrieli, was especially prominent as organ and clavier player and
composer during this epoch, publishing a number of such dances written
for the organ or the clavier.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Froberger</b>.—The devastating Thirty Years’ War (1618-48) put an
end to artistic ambition during its progress. However, art quickly
recovered at its close, and a number of worthy musicians appeared. An
interesting figure among them, and a man who has been called the first
German clavier virtuoso, was <b>Johann Jacob Froberger</b> (1605-1667).
Showing great promise as a boy, he was brought to the notice of the
Austrian Kaiser, Ferdinand III, who sent him to Rome, where he studied
with Frescobaldi for three years. After this we hear of him as a
successful performer at Paris, and, on his return to Vienna, as court
organist, in which position he won widespread fame. A remarkable story
is told of a perilous journey to England, where he arrived penniless,
and of his subsequent recognition and his cordial reception by Charles
II, who was delighted with his improvisation upon the harpsichord.
Afterwards returning to Vienna, he resigned his post there, through
some disagreement, and lived afterwards in retirement. In a number of
Caprices, Toccatas and the like, written in the contrapuntal style,
he definitely adopted the five-lined staff, and introduced many
embellishments, after the French fashion. He possessed much charming
melodic invention, and, in his Toccatas employed a treatment of his
subject in definite sections, which afterwards appeared in the fugue
form. Froberger anticipates the <i>program style</i> of music, as he is said
to have improvised descriptions of events, like that of the Count von
Thurn’s crossing of the Rhine, which he depicted in twenty-six pieces.</p>
<p><b>Johann Kaspar Kerl</b> (1625-90), also sent by Ferdinand III to
Rome, studied there with Carissimi, the oratorio writer, becoming
accomplished as an extemporizer. He occupied a number of organ
positions in Vienna and Munich, also teaching the clavier, and wrote
compositions which show a tendency toward the modern scale systems.
<b>Johann Pachelbel</b> (1653-1706), celebrated as organ and clavier
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
player, wrote pleasing works for the clavier, in which he tried to
follow out the characteristics of the instrument. Many of these were
in the form of variations. <b>Georg Muffat</b> (d. 1704) showed in
his compositions a tendency toward French ornamentation, and his son
<b>Gottlieb</b> (1683-1770), a pupil of the contrapuntist J. J. Fux,
was organist to the Kaiser Charles VI, in Vienna, and clavier teacher
to the Imperial family. His clavier compositions were in the form of
Versettes and Toccatas.</p>
<p><b>Eighteenth Century Clavier Composers</b>.—The Thirty Years’
War exercised a demoralizing influence upon music trades, and many
excellent musicians were unable to have their compositions published
in consequence. The result is, that comparatively few specimens of the
works of the composers mentioned have come down to us in available
form. Approaching the 18th century, we now come to a group of composers
who represent the most brilliant epoch of early clavier work. Their
productions, while retaining the dignity and complexity of the
contrapuntal school, yet use its material with a freedom of modulation
and of dissonant chords sufficient to express genuine emotional ideas
through their medium.</p>
<p><b>Reinken and Buxtehude</b>.—The Hamburg organist <b>Johann Adam
Reinken</b> (1623-1722), a native of Holland, wrote a number of
clavier compositions, publishing in 1704, pieces for two violins and
harpsichord. <b>Dietrich Buxtehude</b> (1637-1707), organist at St.
Mary’s Church, Lübeck, from 1668, excelled in free style of writing for
clavier. The latter gave a series of Sunday evening concerts at his
church which gained renown through all the surrounding country; and J.
S. Bach himself is said to have walked to these concerts, a distance of fifty miles.</p>
<p><b>Instrumental Polyphonic Forms</b>.—These men have been mentioned
largely because their work made possible the results which Bach
afterwards attained from an elaboration of what they had already
accomplished. It was among such eminent German organists that the
instrumental Fugue, the highest instrumental type of polyphonic music,
took definite shape, consisting of an Exposition, in which the Subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Answer and Countersubject were announced by the various voices; and a
subsequent Development, in which, according to certain laws more or
less strict, the material presented was carried through a variety of
phases and brought finally to a triumphant close. Of other forms, like
the Toccata and Canzona, the tendency came to be toward more freedom
of treatment on the one hand, and an increasing definiteness and
consistency on the other.</p>
<p><b>Handel’s Early Life</b>.—A composer must now be mentioned whose
work lay chiefly in other fields than the clavier, but who nevertheless
drew much of his inspiration from the strings of the harpsichord. This
was <b>George Frederick Handel</b> (1685-1759), who was born at Halle,
and whose musical genius asserted itself so strenuously that, although
his father was strongly opposed, he learned the harpsichord as a mere
child, and became so proficient a performer that the reigning Duke
of Saxe-Weissenfels, hearing him play, insisted on his receiving a
thorough musical education. So he was placed under Zachau, a competent
organist and musician, at his native place, with whom he studied
diligently. After his father’s death he went to Hamburg, entering the
orchestra of the Opera house and rising to the post of harpsichordist.
Launching out as an opera composer, he began to acquire a reputation,
and in 1706 went to Italy, meeting many distinguished musicians there,
among them Domenico Scarlatti, with whom he had a contest as to ability
as clavichordist and organist, and winning fresh laurels.</p>
<p><b>Handel in England</b>.—In 1707, he became music director to the
Elector of Hanover, but quickly left the post for England, where,
with the exception of short intervals, he passed the remainder of his
life, becoming a naturalized English subject. It was no wonder that
he was so warmly attached to his adopted country, since he became the
popular idol, even winning over the king, George I, formerly Elector of
Hanover, who, on his accession to the throne, was at first angry with
Handel for his desertion of the post in his service at Hanover.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
<b>Handel’s Operas and Oratorios</b>.—Handel was of an irascible
disposition, and, living in the artificial atmosphere of London,
among wits and satirists like Dr. Johnson, Addison and Pope, he was
constantly embroiled with the cabals of his rivals, and the fickleness
of the public. He produced a great number of operas, most of them
successful; but as theatrical manager he met with severe losses, and
finally gave up opera writing in despair, and turned to the composition
of oratorios. The result was that in this form he has left his most
enduring and elevated compositions; for while his operas were sometimes
written down to the popular taste for empty Italian melody, the lofty
themes of his oratorios inspired him to his grandest and most sincere
style, which, moreover, was rendered the more dramatic and intelligible
by his knowledge of the requirements of his audiences.</p>
<p><b>Handel’s Clavier Works</b>.—Handel was an expert performer on the
harpsichord, for which he wrote two sets of Suites, besides a number of
single pieces. The Suites, of which the first set is by far the better,
are written mostly in the <i>dance forms</i>, but with the interpolation
of more serious forms, such as Airs, Variations and Fugues. The
<i>contrapuntal style</i> is here most <i>prominent</i>, although <i>with harmonic
basis</i>, and with a laxity in the strictness of the voice writing,
caused by the occasional use of extra notes to complete chords. Some of
the variations are worked up to effective climaxes, and have running
passages and broken chords, in which the resources of the clavier are
cleverly drawn upon.</p>
<p><b>Handel’s Last Years</b>.—Handel became blind in 1752, but continued
to take part in the performances of his works till the year of his
death. Choleric as was his temperament, the known generosity of his
nature and his devotion to the ideals of his art made him the idol of
the English people. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Mattheson</b>.—A close associate of Handel, when he was in the
Hamburg orchestra, was <b>Johann Mattheson</b> (1681-1764), famed
for his literary writings on musical subjects no less than for his
musical ability. He wrote suites, a sonata and fugues in two parts, for
clavier, which were of excellent workmanship.</p>
<p><b>Bach’s Early Life</b>.—But all other names in the domain of
polyphonic instrumental music pale before that of <b>Johann Sebastian
Bach</b>, the culmination of the school of voice writing, and the
musician who put the stamp of greatness on all former styles, while at
the same time acting as guide to future fields of composition. Born at
Eisenach in 1685, as a scion of a family the members of which had been
musical leaders for generations, he seems to have embodied in himself
the sum of the genius of his forefathers. The story of his life is a
prosaic one, as he filled it with unflagging industry, carrying out
his unswerving ideals of his art, caring little for mere popularity,
and rearing a large family of sons and daughters, some of whom proved
worthy to continue his work. As a boy, he lost both parents at the
age of ten, and was taught clavier playing by his elder brother,
Johann Christian, who took him in charge. He seized with avidity every
opportunity to study his beloved music, copying hundreds of pages of
manuscript, listening to every musical performance possible, drinking
in and assimilating the ideas thus gained, to reproduce them later on,
stamped with his genius.</p>
<p><b>Later Life</b>.—At his brother’s death he went to Lüneburg as choir
boy, where he became acquainted with Reinken’s work. At eighteen he
was violinist in the court band at Weimar, shortly afterward becoming
organist at a church at Arnstadt. His next position was as court
organist at Weimar, in 1708, where many of his most important organ
compositions were written. This post he left in 1717 for that of court
chapel-master at Anhalt-Köthen, where he remained six years, after
which he went to Leipzig, as Cantor of the Thomasschule, staying there
till his death, in 1750.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Incidents of Bach’s Career</b>.—Bach’s life was not altogether a
happy one, as he was much annoyed at the persecutions of his rivals;
and, like Handel, he was afflicted with blindness in his last years.
Never considering the element of mere popularity in his work, his
greatness was little appreciated in his lifetime; and it was fifty
years after his death before it began to receive recognition. A
pleasant incident of his declining years was his cordial reception
by Frederick the Great at his court, in 1747, where Bach’s son was
in favor as harpsichord player, and where Bach was shown a number of
excellent new Silbermann pianofortes. It is a curious circumstance that
he and Handel, although born in the same year, were destined never to meet.</p>
<p><b>The Well-Tempered Clavichord</b>.—It has been stated that Bach
adopted the principle of Equal Temperament for clavier tuning. In
support of this he wrote twenty-four preludes and fugues, one in each
major and minor key, requiring, therefore, equal temperament for
their performance; and later added a second similar volume. The whole
forty-eight make up the monumental work called the “Well-Tempered
Clavichord”; and this work, written originally for the clavichord,
has remained the bulwark of piano playing to the present day. Its
fugues, written with consummate mastery of the technic of instrumental
polyphony, are not only models of skill in voice writing, but also are
made the vehicles of genuine moods and emotions; while each preceding
prelude gives the keynote of expression to its following fugue,
although written in a much freer style, frequently closely allied with
the works of the purely harmonic school.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
<b>Bach’s Other Clavier Works</b>.—Bach wrote also sonatas and
concertos, the latter for one, two or three claviers, sometimes
with string accompaniment. These works, although comprising several
movements, <i>do not</i> otherwise <i>coincide</i> with the <i>harmonic sonata
form</i>, since their style is more polyphonic, and since they are
occupied mainly with the <i>development</i> of a <i>single</i> subject. His
suites, of which he wrote two sets, called respectively English
and French, are no less important, since in them the dance forms
are invested with a seriousness and an artistic finish hitherto
unattained. Of other clavier works, his famous “Chromatic Fantasie”
has a wealth of harmonic combinations, fiery runs and arpeggios, and
dramatic recitative which give it a worthy place in the Romantic school
developed much later, and of whose style it was the forerunner. His
“Inventions,” studies written originally for his children, in two or
three parts, are an excellent introduction to the study of his larger works.</p>
<p><b>Reforms in Fingering</b>.—Another gift of Bach’s to coming
generations was his <i>thorough revision of clavier playing</i>. Raising
the hand above the keys from its former flat position, he <i>brought
the thumb into use</i>, and by inventing the scale fingering, afterwards
universally adopted, he opened the way to the style of brilliant and
smoothly running passages which was afterwards so highly developed.
Thus Bach, while putting the final touch to the old forms, gave an
impetus to the harmonic style, which was then in its infancy, and of
which we shall now trace the course.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The German Sonata Composers, to Haydn</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Formation of Harmonic Design</b>.—Side by side with the ultimate
development of polyphonic music in its perfected instrumental form,
the forms of the new harmonic style were being worked out, by long
processes of development. Finally, just as the Fugue came to be adopted
as the highest form of the old school, so the Sonata was chosen as
the most dignified exponent of the new art. But, while the old school
arrived at a high state of perfection at the hands of Handel and Bach,
the necessity for inventing and experimenting with the possibilities of
the new forms made the first attempts in this direction seem childish
and crude beside Bach’s work; so that it was several generations
after him before the harmonic style was brought to the stage at which
it could be made to express ideas of equal magnitude, and do it successfully.</p>
<p><b>Development of the Sonata</b>.—The original plan associated with
the Sonata was that of combining several movements in such a way
as to appeal, in the completed product, to all kinds of <i>emotion</i>,
<i>intellectual</i>, <i>spiritual</i> and <i>physical</i>. In the hands of its
founders, the Italian violinists, the exposition of this thought had
been mainly contrapuntal. We have seen how Domenico Scarlatti arrived
at a style in which a single part, supported by an accompaniment, was
applied to the clavier, in a manner which brought out its striking
characteristics; and we have now to trace the progress of this style in
Germany, up to the point where the various contributions of different
composers could be united into a systematic and fixed form, sufficient
for the free expression of the highest musical inspiration, and adapted
to all the varied demands of instrumental music.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Essential Elements of a Sonata</b>.—Certain points seem to have
been generally agreed upon as necessary components of the Sonata. The
first was its <i>union</i> of <i>several movements</i>, from two up to five, or
occasionally even more. The second was that the <i>first movement</i> should
display the most <i>ingenuity</i> and <i>elaboration</i>. This movement thus
came to receive the most attention, and showed a process of evolution
from the simple dance form consisting of a modulation from a principal
key to a contrasting key and back again, to a <i>highly organised</i> and
conventional <i>art-form</i>—a form, moreover, of such a capacity that it
could be used as the mould for the principal movement of a wide range
of compositions, from a short pianoforte sonata to a grand symphony.</p>
<p><b>Changes in the Old Dance Form</b>.—In this evolution, the first
half of the dance form was made to consist of a Subject, either
thematic or melodic, clearly defining the key, and then a modulating
passage, generally freer in its runs and arpeggios, leading up to
the point of contrast; and the first section was then repeated.
The greatest changes took place in the second half. At first, this
consisted in the repeat of the Principal Theme in the contrasting
key, and a return to the first key through modulations similar to
those in the first section; later, however, since this design gave
little opportunity for a display of the composer’s originality,
the enunciation of the Subject in the contrasting key was followed
by a free passage, which gave ample scope to the composer’s fancy;
after which the subject again appeared in the principal key, with a
concluding passage in the same key.</p>
<p><b>Establishment of the Cyclic Form</b>.—The form as a whole was now
practically divided into three sections, and a better balance was
given to this division by the omission of the second appearance of the
Subject in the contrasting key, and the substitution of other material,
either relevant or contrasting. The movement now assumed a cyclic
form—a statement, leading to a point of contrast, a free fantasia, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
finally the statement, leading to a close. This was practically the
course of development of what has been named the Sonata Form, up
to the time of Haydn. We are now prepared to consider the especial
contributions of composers to this form.</p>
<p><b>First Printed Clavier Sonata</b>.—The first printed clavier sonata
seems to have been published by <b>Johann Kuhnau</b> (1660?-1722).
This was in the key of B-flat, and was the last of several pieces in
the same volume. In the preface, the author gives a semi-apology for
its introduction, saying that he sees no reason why sonatas should not
be written for the clavier as well as for any other instrument. This
sonata begins with an Allegro, followed by a fugal movement; and in the
following Adagio movement, the tendency to put the slow movement into
a contrasting key is illustrated, as this is in D-flat major. After
another Allegro, there is a <i>Da Capo</i> to the first part.</p>
<p><b>Other Sonatas by Kuhnau</b>.—It was difficult for the early sonata
writers to break away entirely from the old polyphonic style; and when
a part appeared in the nature of a Free Fantasia, they generally had
recourse to fugal work, having <i>no precedent</i> in <i>harmonic music</i> to
fall back upon. Thus, in his seven sonatas published in 1696, entitled
“Fresh Fruits for the Clavier,” which show more individuality in
melodic invention, Kuhnau uses the fugal style whenever the harmonic
forms fail him. These sonatas show a prevalence of ornaments, which,
he says, are “sugar to sweeten the fruits.” A remarkable collection of
clavier pieces are his six Bible sonatas, in which the form is entirely
outside of the development traced above, since the various movements of
each sonata simply follow the lines of a Bible story, like that of the
“Combat between David and Goliath,” which they illustrate. As samples
of program music, they proceed in the steps of Pachelbel, and others on
record. Kuhnau studied law, and was from 1682 organist at St. Thomas’
Church, at Leipzig, where he preceded J. S. Bach.</p>
<p><b>Frederick the Great’s Influence</b>.—A great impetus was given to
German clavier music by the interest with which, like all other forms
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of instrumental music, it was viewed by Frederick the Great of Prussia
(r. 1740-86). This warlike but thoroughly Teutonic monarch gathered
at his court a brilliant coterie of instrumentalists, delighting to
perform with them on his favorite instrument, the flute. Although this
musical inspiration was disturbed by the wars in which he engaged, and
especially by the Seven Years’ War (1756-63), the growth of clavier
music was nevertheless steady.</p>
<p><b>Musical Journals</b>.—A number of musical journals which appeared
from 1760 on, contributed also to this enthusiasm, in giving clavier
composers a medium for bringing their works before the public, and also
in giving them the chance to profit by one another’s experiments. Many
writers thus came to the fore, who aided materially in the elaboration
of harmonic music material.</p>
<p><b>Other Early Composers</b>.—Of these, <b>Gottfried Heinrich
Stoelzel</b> (1690-1749), chapel-master at Saxe-Gotha, wrote an
“enharmonic” clavier sonata in three parts, a Largo in C minor, in 4/4
time; a short fugue; and a 3/8 movement, in harmonic form, in which
experiments in modulation were tried. His successor at Saxe-Gotha was
<b>Georg Benda</b> (1721-95), who published a number of clavier pieces
and sonatas, besides two concertos for clavier and string quartet, all
of which show a desire for genuine expression in the harmonic form.
The first four-hand sonatas seem to have been published by <b>Charles
Heinrich Müller</b>, of Halberstadt, in 1783, and another appeared
in 1784, by <b>Ernst Wilhelm Wolf</b> (1735-92), court chapel-master
in Saxe-Weimar, the writer of numerous other clavier sonatas and
concertos showing great purity and originality of style. At the
court of Frederick the Great, at Berlin, <b>Christoph Nichelmann</b>
(1717-62), a pupil of Bach, and <b>Carl Fasch</b> (1736-1800) were
successively second harpsichordists. Both wrote sonatas, those of the
former in two movements, while those of the latter had generally three,
of a brilliant and attractive style. <b>Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg</b>
(1718-95), the distinguished Berlin theoretician, was more successful
in contrapuntal work than in his sonatas, written in freer style.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Georg Christoph Wagenseil</b> (1715-77), pupil of J. J. Fux, court
music teacher and celebrated clavier virtuoso, wrote sonatas for
clavier and violin and a number for clavier alone.</p>
<p><b>Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</b>.—Perhaps the most striking
developments, however, were at the hands of the sons of J. S. Bach, who
were all, having come under his direct instruction, of refined musical
judgment, while some of them possessed marks of his genius. Of these,
<b>Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</b> (1710-84), the eldest, called the Bach
of Halle, from his long residence there, studied at the University of
Leipzig, distinguishing himself in mathematics; was organist at Dresden
and Halle successively, and finally came to Frederick the Great’s
court, at Berlin, through the influence of his brother Carl. Although
he possessed great gifts as a player and composer, his dissipated
habits brought him to disgrace, and he died in poverty. He wrote many
clavier compositions, showing a bold use of harmonies, and including
sonatas which have decidedly instrumental themes and development. A
large number of his father’s manuscripts known to have been in his
possession have been irretrievably lost.</p>
<p><b>Johann Christian Bach</b>, the London Bach, youngest of J. S.
Bach’s sons, was born at Leipzig in 1735, and died at London in 1782.
He studied with his brother, Carl, after his father’s death, and,
afterwards going to Italy, became organist at the Milan Cathedral.
Gaining great favor in this capacity, he was appointed concert-director
at London in 1759, and there he became a popular favorite, producing
several operas and receiving the appointment of music master to the
royal family. His Italian experiences influenced his sonata writing,
as his <i>subjects</i> are in the style of the popular, though somewhat
trivial <i>Italian melody</i>. Yet he introduced some striking improvements,
notably that of employing a <i>second contrasting subject</i>, instead of a
mere modulating or closing passage, at the end of the first and third
sections of the sonata form. His graceful and melodious works were
fashionable in London society.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">C. P. E. Bach</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>C. P. E. Bach</b>.—The third and greatest of Bach’s sons was
<b>Carl Philip Emanuel Bach</b>, the Berlin Bach. Inheriting his
father’s love of genuine and forceful expression, he had no less lofty
ideals of his art, though recognizing his inferiority in talent. Also,
perceiving that the harmonic school was in the line of progression, he
devoted himself to it, thus producing purely <i>harmonic works</i>, which
were only limited by the lack of resources thus far discovered. He was
born at Weimar, in 1714, and, though a student of law and philosophy
at Leipzig, he finally decided to give rein to his natural bent toward
the musical profession. Conducting and composing for a musical society
at Frankfort, he was appointed first clavier player at the court of
Frederick the Great, at Berlin, where he stayed from 1740 to 1767, in
high favor on account of his sterling musicianship, and enjoying the
society of many distinguished musicians of the day. In 1767, he became
musical director of the principal church in Hamburg, where he remained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
till his death, in 1788. A vigorous worker throughout his life, he left
a large number of compositions, including two hundred and ten clavier
pieces and fifty-two concertos for clavier and orchestra, besides much
chamber music, eighteen symphonies, oratorios and cantatas.</p>
<p><b>C. P. E. Bach’s Sonatas</b>.—His most enduring and important
work was in connection with the pianoforte sonata, since under his
hands it began to assume <i>definite shape</i>. In the six sets of sonatas
published, the number of movements is generally fixed at three, of
which the third is frequently in the harmonic form of the Rondo, which
consists in the recurrence of a principal theme, with modulatory
episodes between its appearances. Hence the order of movements, which,
in the earlier writers, took all sorts of forms from fugue to dance
form, becomes Allegro, Adagio, Rondo. Bach’s <i>themes</i> are also made
very characteristic, founded upon some easily-recognized <i>instrumental
figure</i>. In the <i>development</i> portion of the sonata form he does not
resort to the polyphonic style, but <i>uses phrases or sections from
the first part in new combinations and keys</i>. Sometimes, also, the
direction is given in the repeat of the first section, to introduce
variations of the text at will.</p>
<p><b>His Theoretical Works</b>.—Bach published at Berlin, in 1753, an
essay on “The True Method of Playing the Clavier,” in which he gives a
definite exposition of his father’s reforms in playing, treating the
position of the hand, embellishments and artistic rendering, which he
says should touch the hearts of the hearers. A second part, published
in 1762, discusses the science of accompaniment and improvisation.</p>
<p><b>Adoption of the Piano</b>.—The clavichord, notwithstanding its
feeble tone, remained his favorite instrument on account of its powers
of expression, in which he delighted. His brother, Johann Christian,
was one of the first definitely to adopt the new pianoforte. J. G.
Müthel published in 1771 what were probably the first compositions
mentioning the pianoforte for their performance, a duet for two
pianofortes or harpsichords; after the time of C. P. E. Bach, clavier
compositions were written in general distinctively for the pianoforte
and not for the clavier.

<h2>LESSON XXX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Franz Joseph Haydn</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Three Great Sonata Writers</b>.—In the year of C. P. E. Bach’s
death, 1788, three men had already entered the arena as champions
of that Sonata Form to which he contributed so much. Haydn was then
fifty-six, Mozart thirty-two and Beethoven eighteen years of age. All
three added to the glory of Vienna by making it their dwelling-place in
their later years; and the three formed a triumvirate which not only
gave to the Sonata a permanent and complete form, but also brought this
form into absolute subservience to the expression of every variety of
emotional thought.</p>
<p><b>Haydn’s Childhood</b>.—Franz Joseph Haydn, a native of Rohrau, in
lower Austria, was born on March 31, 1732, the second of a family of
twelve children. His father, an humble wheelwright, was accustomed
to bring his family together in the evenings and holidays, as was
the German custom, to unite in song; and the true ear and feeling
for rhythm of little “Sepperl,” as Joseph was called, was quickly
noticeable. So a cousin of his father, who was a schoolmaster at
Hainburg, was allowed to take the boy home with him, placing him in the
school choir, and directing his studies, which included singing, and
the playing of the violin and other instruments.</p>
<p><b>St. Stephen’s Choir, Vienna</b>.—George Reutter, precentor of St.
Stephen’s Cathedral, at Vienna, paid a visit to the school and was
attracted by the child’s “sweet, weak voice,” as he expressed it, and
offered him a position in his choir. As this was considered a rare
opportunity, he was allowed to go, and at the age of eight we find him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
installed in the choir school at Vienna, attending the daily service
and choir practice, besides the regular school studies. But Reutter
seems to have lost his personal interest in the lad, neglecting him
in various ways, doing nothing with his work in musical theory, and
finally dropping all his tuition. Haydn was fond of mischief; and when
his voice began to break and his brother Michael became soloist in his
place, his cruel master took the pretext of some trifling prank to turn
him adrift, penniless, into the street.</p>
<p><b>Hardships in Vienna</b>.—At the age of seventeen, therefore, he
wandered the streets all of one rainy November night, with no friend to
whom to turn. Finally, in the morning, he met an acquaintance formerly
at the school, Spangler, a tenor singer, himself nearly as poor as
Haydn. Nevertheless, he took the outcast home to his garret, where
he was eking out an existence with his family; and thus temporarily
provided for, Haydn set about finding work to do. Small jobs, like
playing in bands, or at weddings and baptisms, and singing in choirs,
he eagerly sought; his spare moments he occupied in writing music for
serenades or garden-parties. While undergoing these hardships, however,
he was becoming familiar with the music dear to the people’s heart, and
also with the varied effects of instrumental combinations.</p>
<p><b>Studies and New Friends</b>.—In 1750, he rented a garret in a
house in Vienna, and, having secured a dilapidated spinet, set himself
diligently to work to study all available musical compositions, notably
those of the new sonata order, and especially the sonatas of C. P.
E. Bach. Theoretical works, also, like the “Gradus ad Parnassum” of
J. J. Fux, and Mattheson’s work on conducting, were eagerly devoured
by the youthful enthusiast. By a piece of good fortune, Metastasio,
the popular opera librettist, roomed in the same house, and learning
of the talent hidden away in the garret, sought Haydn out, gave him
Italian lessons, and ultimately started him on the road to success
by recommending him as clavier teacher to a Spanish lady, to whose daughter he gave lessons.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Connection with Porpora</b>.—Her singing master was the renowned
opera composer, Porpora, who recognized Haydn’s talent as accompanist,
and proceeded to make him useful to himself, giving him instruction in
composition in return for his services, which were frequently of even a
menial nature. Accompanying Porpora on his journeys, he met musicians
like Wagenseil and Gluck; and at the age of twenty had written many
compositions, including a mass in F, an opera and many works of the
sonata order, founded on the style of C. P. E. Bach.</p>
<p><b>Better Times</b>.—Better times now opened before Haydn. Gaining
influential friends, he won, through them, the post of music director
and composer to Count Morzin, a position which he held only a short
time, since the Count gave up his musical establishment soon. But he
was immediately engaged by the wealthy and cultivated Prince Paul
Esterhazy, who had been charmed at hearing a symphony of Haydn’s, as
assistant director of music at his estate at Eisenstadt. The same year
Haydn made an unhappy marriage with the daughter of Keller, a wigmaker,
which he had cause to regret for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p><b>Orchestras in Germany</b>.—To understand Haydn’s work with the
Esterhazy family, it will be necessary to review the state of music
in Germany at this time. When the orchestral overtures of the Italian
operas had become used as concert pieces, a great stimulus was given
to this kind of music. Concertos, string quartets, trios, and, most
important of all, symphonies, came to be written in great numbers;
and throughout Germany a mania for orchestral music arose. Wealthy
families vied with each other in the size and prestige of their musical
establishments, which included instrumentalists and vocalists; and the
smaller gentry even pressed their domestic servants into the service,
inducing them to study instruments, and to perform string quartets and
the like on occasions. Inasmuch as a great part of the music written
for these was not published, and exchange of music in manuscript
between different establishments was attended with some difficulty, it
was necessary that the music director should have the ability to write
his own music, as well as to direct it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Haydn’s Work at Esterhazy</b>.—A rare opportunity therefore
opened to Haydn, with his exceptional gifts as a composer, when
he was placed at the head of an establishment like that of the
Esterhazys’, which was perhaps the most brilliant and competent
in Europe. He remained in active service with this family for
thirty-three years, during which Prince Nicolas Esterhazy succeeded
his brother Paul, upon the death of the latter, in 1762. Nicolas,
called the “Great,” on account of his love of magnificence and his
lavish style of living, built a sumptuous summer palace near Süttor,
in Bohemia; and here he spent most of his time, with his troup of
retainers, entertaining royalty, in a style comparable with that of
Versailles. Werner, his head director, who had never appreciated
Haydn’s gifts on account of his old-school principles, died in
1766, and Haydn, who had made a firm friend of Prince Nicolas, was
given his place. The orchestra and singers were now entirely under
his command; the former was increased from the original number of
sixteen to thirty, all capable performers; so that his life was spent
in a round of rehearsals, dramatic performances and concerts for the
numerous entertainments constantly in progress. Two well-equipped
theatres, one for operas and dramas, and the other for marionette
plays, gave him an opportunity for adequate performances; he thus had
an exceptional chance to study the effects in his numerous quartets,
trios, symphonies and operas, at first hand.</p>
<p><b>Journeys to Vienna</b>.—On several occasions, Prince Nicolas took
his entire troupe of musicians to Vienna, where Haydn conducted the
performances, meeting also the distinguished musicians of the day. It
was on one of these journeys, in 1785, that he met Mozart, whose genius
he was quick to appreciate, and who, from being his pupil, finally gave
to Haydn the added inspiration of his own brilliant thoughts. Haydn’s
reputation had now spread abroad, and his compositions were eagerly
looked for throughout the musical world.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Haydn in London</b>.—On Prince Nicolas’ death, in 1790, Prince
Anton, his brother, succeeded, who, however, dismissed the orchestra,
providing for Haydn by a liberal pension. Haydn’s time was now his
own; and he decided to settle in Vienna; but an English impresario and
publisher named Salomon now offered him such exceptional inducements
to come to London that he accepted the offer. He was received with
great honor, being granted the degree of Doctor of Music from Oxford
University. He also conducted twelve grand symphonies, especially
written for this visit, which were, moreover, some of his finest
productions. On a second visit, in 1794-5, he excited even greater
enthusiasm; and he returned to Vienna supplied with money sufficient to
insure an old age free from pecuniary want. Some of his latest works
were the Austrian National Hymn, and his oratorios of “The Creation”
and “The Seasons,” which immediately attained a popularity that has
even yet hardly diminished.</p>
<p><b>Honors</b>.—Haydn, in his old age, was showered with honors
both at home and abroad; a culminating point was reached when, on
his seventy-sixth birthday, at a performance of “The Creation,” his
friends, including many representatives of royalty, united to do him
honor. His genial, child-like disposition won him the sobriquet of
“Papa Haydn”; and this brightness and simplicity of thought he so
transmitted to his compositions that they carry his atmosphere of
sunshine wherever they are performed. He died in Vienna, soon after its
capture by the French, in the Napoleonic wars, May 31, 1809.</p>
<p><b>Importance of His Work</b>.—Haydn has been called the father of
the Symphony and the String Quartet. In neither case is this strictly
true, since he had predecessors in both fields; but his work was none
the less important, since he collected the scattered threads of their
attempts, and wound them into a concise and definite art form, stamped
with the hallmarks of his own genius. The seal of artistic completeness
which he placed on the form of the Sonata was his greatest achievement;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and, written in this form, his symphonies and quartets were simply an
enlargement of his clavier works, the symphonies having an added Minuet
movement between the second and last movements of the clavier form of
sonata, thus extending the piece to larger proportions.</p>
<p><b>Sonata-Form as Fixed by Haydn</b>.—In these clavier sonatas, Haydn
fixed the form which had been the subject of so many experiments, once
and for all. The number of movements with him is almost invariably
three, of which the first, at least, is in the sonata-form. This
consists of a first section, the <b>Exposition</b>, in which the first
subject, a distinct melody having the Teutonic individuality, is
stated, defining the principal key; and a second subject, more lengthy
and diverse in character, brings on a close in the contrasting key. In
the second section, or <b>Development</b>, phrases or motives from the
first section are cleverly intertwined in modulating keys, with running
scales or arpeggios as connecting links. These, however, lead naturally
into the first subject, in its original key, which opens the third
section, or <b>Reprise</b>. This section is practically like the first,
save that the second subject and the close are transferred into the
principal key, in which the movement ends.</p>
<p><b>The Second Movement</b>.—The second, or slow movement, is cast
sometimes in the same form, abbreviated, and sometimes in a simpler
form. The lack of sustaining power in Haydn’s pianoforte, and his
attempt to atone for this by trills and ornaments, make this less
successful than the other movements; a result which is also caused by
the fact that intensity and depth of emotion had not yet been developed
in the harmonic school of music. In key, this movement was contrasted
with the first, sometimes quite sharply, as in one of the sonatas in
E-flat, in which the slow movement is in E major.</p>
<p><b>Third Movement</b>.—The lively third movement is frequently in
the lighter form of the Rondo, or it may be a set of Variations, or a
Minuet. This movement, though sprightly, is apt to be somewhat thin in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
its harmonies, and trivial in development. Nevertheless, these last two
movements show an expansion of the forms of the older writers, and a
definiteness of character which insured their future development.</p>
<p><b>Definiteness and Unity</b>.—This element of absolute definiteness
is the most striking feature of Haydn’s work—definiteness none the
less in the general form than in each individual component. Each part
of each section ends with a cadence, giving it absolute finality,
and making the whole a combination of small entities, which, though
distinct, are yet relevant and nicely balanced.</p>
<p><b>Humor and Freshness</b>.—Another quality which he introduced
was that of humor, which is prominent not only in the general tone
of geniality, but in little unexpected twists of harmony, melody or
rhythm, which give an irresistibly comic effect. Especially is this
true in his symphonies, where the various tone colors are used for such
results. Especial mention should also be made of his Masses, in which
tunefulness of melody and sprightly rhythms combine to give an enduring
popularity. Altogether, Haydn’s work is redolent of the spring of
musical activity, where the novelty of each harmonic effect is employed
with an outburst of joy, and where one travels, as it were, through a
sunny garden, filled with the flowers of musical thoughts.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span></span>.</h2>
<p>While Haydn’s genius was shining steadily as a fixed star, Mozart
flashed across the musical heaven, meteorlike, throwing a flood of
light over the music world. The knowledge which others spent years in
acquiring seemed his by birthright; and thus, although the years of his
life were few, the period of his artistic activity was proportionately long.</p>
<p><b>Mozart’s Early Musical Training</b>.—Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
was born at Salzburg, January 27, 1756. His father, himself of some
reputation as a composer and as the author of the first German violin
method, was quick to perceive the child’s sensitiveness toward music;
and began instruction in clavier playing when Wolfgang was but four
years old, teaching also his daughter, Maria Anna, five years older.
Wolfgang was an exceedingly delicate and receptive child; and at the
age of six he had not only acquired remarkable proficiency on the
instrument, but had composed a number of little pieces, and a clavier sonata.</p>
<p><b>First Concert Tours</b>.—Realizing the remarkable talent of his
children, Mozart, the father, in 1762, ventured on a concert trip with
them to Munich, and later to Vienna, where their playing became the
sensation of the hour, and where they were received by the Emperor,
Franz Josef I, at his palace. Having been presented with a small
violin, Mozart acquired facility in its technic with extraordinary
quickness, as also was the case when he attempted the use of organ
pedals. The brilliant French court was then the Mecca of artists; and
in 1763, the children were taken to Paris, where their successes were
redoubled, and where they gave two brilliant concerts, after having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
played before the royal family at Versailles. At Paris, moreover, the
opus 1 and opus 2 of the little Mozart were published, each comprising
two sonatas for harpsichord, with accompaniment of violin or flute.</p>
<p><b>England</b>.—Proceeding now to England, the children won fresh
laurels, remaining there fifteen months; during which time Wolfgang
excited the admiration of the king, George III, by his sight-reading of
works by Handel, Bach and others. He also wrote other sonatas, and his
first symphonies. Returning to Salzburg, after a three years’ absence,
Mozart applied himself to serious study, composing his first oratorio
and opera, which latter was not performed in public, and also appearing
as conductor at a concert in which his “Solemn Mass” was performed.</p>
<p><b>Honors in Italy</b>.—Renewed triumphs awaited him in Italy, where
his father took him in 1769, and where his genius was immediately
recognized in the leading cities. At Rome he was honored by the Order
of the Golden Spur, conferred by the Pope; and in Bologna was admitted
to membership in the exclusive Philharmonic Academy, passing with ease
an examination which would have appalled many mature musicians; in
Milan his opera “Mitridate” was received enthusiastically, and given
twenty consecutive performances, under his own direction.</p>
<p><b>Journey to Paris</b>.—Returning to Salzburg, Mozart took up the
post previously given him of music director to the Archbishop; but
his emolument, at first wholly wanting, was insignificant, and the
Archbishop, having little appreciation of his abilities, proved a
thankless taskmaster. During this time he made several journeys
to Milan, producing new dramatic works there; and in 1777, as his
Salzburg position had become intolerable, he resolved to give it up,
and to repair to Paris. Starting on this journey with his mother, he
stopped at Munich, and then at Augsburg, where he became interested
in the Stein pianofortes, henceforth adopting them for his concert
work. At Mannheim he heard the famous orchestra, of which Stamitz
was the founder, whose command of instrumental brilliancy and color
made so powerful an impression upon him that he transmitted it to his
succeeding orchestral compositions.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
<b>“Idomeneo” and “Il Seraglio.”</b>—At Paris, he found society
divided into two warring operatic factions, led by Gluck and Piccini,
and averse to anything else in music. Saddened also by the death of his
mother, he returned to Salzburg, and resumed his former post with the
Archbishop. Receiving an order to write an opera for the Carnival at
Munich, he produced his “Idomeneo” there in 1781. Shortly after, he was
compelled, through ill-treatment, to break finally with the Archbishop,
and he resolved to settle in Vienna. In the same year, 1782, in which
he produced there his opera, “Entführung aus dem Serail,” composed by
command of the Emperor, he married Constance Weber.</p>
<p><b>Financial Troubles</b>.—His life from this time was a constant
struggle against poverty; for notwithstanding his wonderful genius, he
received only scant recognition from his patron, the Emperor, although
loyal to him to the end. His existence was eked out chiefly by the sale
of his compositions, which publishers purchased at a low price, by
giving lessons and by playing at concerts; while the jealousy of rivals
furnished a constant source of annoyance.</p>
<p><b>“Figaro,” “Don Giovanni” and Symphonies</b>.—His comic opera, “The
Marriage of Figaro,” produced in Vienna in 1786, came near failing
through these enemies, but was an unqualified success in Prague, where,
in the following year, his masterpiece, “Don Giovanni,” was produced.
On a concert tour in 1786 he was offered an excellent post in the
service of King Frederic Wilhelm II, of Prussia, which he refused,
through loyalty to his Emperor—a devotion which received no reward
save an order to write another opera. In the same year, 1789, his three
most important symphonies were completed—the “Jupiter,” in C, and
those in G minor and E-flat major.</p>
<p><b>Other Operas</b>—<b>Death</b>.—His succeeding operas were “Così
fan Tutte,” performed at Vienna in 1790; “The Clemency of Titus,” given
at Prague in 1791, for the coronation festivities of King Leopold II of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Bohemia, and “The Magic Flute,” produced at Vienna in 1791, which,
through its German subject and style, was a signal success, especially
in his own country. Discouragements and hard work now told upon him;
and in the midst of his labors upon a grand Requiem, he was stricken
down, and died December 5, 1791.</p>
<p><b>Relations with Haydn</b>.—No one admired Mozart’s genius more than
Haydn; and a proof of the latter’s freedom from the petty jealousies of
lesser men is found in the fact that, while he was at first Mozart’s
teacher, he was afterward glad to adopt many of the innovations which
were the result of Mozart’s genius. The labors of the two men admirably
supplemented each other; for Mozart assimilated and blended what Haydn
had definitely stated, adorning the rugged outlines with the graceful
draperies which his skill as a performer and his artistic nature dictated.</p>
<p><b>Italian Influences</b>.—Thus, while Mozart adopted the form of
the Sonata practically as enunciated by Haydn, he was able to impart
new elements to it, drawn from his own experience and individuality.
His Italian journeys, for instance, had brought him into close touch
with the highly-adorned Italian opera style, then everywhere popular;
and this he introduced into his instrumental <i>themes</i>, making them at
once <i>singing</i> and <i>graceful</i> in tone. In the Sonata Form, he made the
<i>second theme</i> more definite, <i>contrasting</i> it with the <i>first</i>, and
frequently casting it in the form of an Italian style of melody, in
distinction from a more terse and thematic principal subject.</p>
<p><b>Mozart as Piano Virtuoso</b>.—As a virtuoso, Mozart immensely
developed the resources of the piano. After the Bachs, J. S. and his
son C. P. E., had established a rational scale fingering, and it was
found possible to introduce passages at once quickly running and smooth
upon the clavier, such scale passages became very frequent in the
compositions of the time, and they were, moreover, well adapted to the
light Viennese action found in the Stein pianos, which Mozart used.
Hence we find <i>scale-runs</i> as the <i>cornerstone of his virtuosity</i>,
constantly employed in florid and transitional passages.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Classic Finish</b>.—But Mozart’s compositions were not simply an
advance in brilliancy, since his slow movements and themes are full
of much genuine sentiment, and give opportunity for that expressive
song-style which he emphasized so strongly. Moreover, his feeling
for artistic finish caused him, by rounding off every detail, to
avoid abruptness, replacing them by little delicate turns of musical
expression and graceful embellishments, which give an atmosphere of
<i>classic repose</i> and finish to the whole.</p>
<p><b>Variations</b>.—Embellishments of this kind are introduced
invariably with such naturalness and fitness as to make them seem
perfectly adapted to the subject in hand, and growing unconsciously out
of it. So Mozart throws a network of <i>embroidery about his themes</i> at
their recurrence which shows their beauties to ever greater advantage.
The ability to do this makes him a specially felicitous composer in
the Variation form, in which some of his most attractive movements and
salon pieces are written.</p>
<p><b>Piano with Other Instruments</b>.—His sense of fitness is shown
also in the vivid <i>contrasts</i> which occur, especially in his Fantasias,
in which brilliant passages are relieved by bits of exquisite melody,
in artistic proportion. All these qualities are manifested in his
pianoforte concertos, which, while replete with flights of virtuosity,
yet always subordinate, cause him to bring this into equal prominence
with the piano, so that the one ably seconds the other in the attempt
to produce a well-rounded and thoroughly genuine musical effect. The
same qualities are exhibited in his sonatas for violin and piano, and
in his piano trios.</p>
<p><b>Especial Characteristics</b>.—Mozart considered three elements
necessary for the true interpretation of piano music, namely, an
<i>expressive legato touch</i>, <i>moderation</i> in the rate of <i>speed</i> of
performance, and <i>strictness</i> in adhering to the <i>time</i> adopted. With
an unfeeling touch or a breakneck velocity he had no patience, and
so had no sympathy with many noted pianists of his day, and notably
Clementi. It has been said that Mozart, almost from his infancy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
thought in music as others do in words; and this thought in music was
regulated by a sense of artistic combination and proportion which
permeated all his works. As samples of virtuosity his piano works have
long been surpassed by the astonishing developments since his time,
and particularly by the added resources of the instrument itself;
but as samples of pure and unaffected music their worth can never be diminished.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Ludwig van Beethoven</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Formalism of Haydn and Mozart</b>.—It has been seen that the
forms of harmonic music, growing out of numerous and sometimes crude
experiments, were brought to a high state of perfection through the
genius of Haydn and Mozart; and that they left a definite structure,
nicely balanced, capable of expressing definite thoughts in a
unified form, and at the same time of allowing free rein to the
composer’s fancy. Of their instrumental works, the definition of the
musician-philosopher J. J. Rousseau (d. 1778), that “music is the art
of combining sounds in a manner agreeable to the ear,” gave a fitting
characterization; for while a tinge of melancholy is occasionally
perceptible, and there are passages of some dramatic intensity,
nevertheless such elements are introduced mainly to give a pleasing
contrast from the even flow of polished and idealized sound.</p>
<p><b>Their Gift to Beethoven</b>.—In other words, neither Haydn nor
Mozart ever sacrifices his sense of artistic finish to the expression
of the heights and depths of human emotion. Putting the seal of genius
upon instrumental forms, they transmitted these forms to another more
colossal mind, which should make use of them, to be sure, but should
absolutely subordinate them to the expression of the burning thoughts
and passions of a great individuality; a mind which, like that of
Shakespeare, was able to look fearlessly upon universal truths, and to
bring these to the light, in this instance through the medium of tone.
While their predecessors, by unwearying attempts, made possible this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
determination of a capable art form, so Haydn and Mozart, in their
turn, paved the way for the fuller expression which Beethoven gave to
music, and which would otherwise not have been possible, since the
vehicle for his thoughts would have been wanting. Thus the opportunity
had arrived for broadening the definition which Rousseau gave, and
announcing the fact that music is the art of the expression of every
emotion, whether pleasurable or painful, through the medium of highly
organized sound.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven’s Early Life</b>.—Ludwig van Beethoven, the last and
greatest of this triumvirate of sonata writers, was a native of
Bonn-on-the-Rhine, where he was born December 16, 1770. His parents
were lowly people, his father a tenor singer in the Elector of
Cologne’s chapel, and his mother a cook; and, moreover, Beethoven’s
early life was an unhappy one, through his father’s irascible
disposition and tendency toward dissipation. Beethoven, of an acutely
sensitive nature, inherited his father’s quick temper and annoyances
at trifles, so that all through his troubled life he was constantly in
a state of irritation against something or someone. Like Mozart, he
showed early and unmistakable signs of a musical susceptibility; unlike
him, however, the unfolding of his genius was ultimately slow, since he
attained to his greatest powers much later in life than his phenomenal
predecessor. His early instruction was begun with his father; but soon
he was placed in the care of several local musicians: Pfeiffer, music
director and oboist; Van der Eeden, the court organist; and especially
the successor to the latter, Neefe (1748-1798), a man of reputation as
organist and composer for the pianoforte. As a result, Beethoven played
the violin well at eight, and at twelve had mastered the works of
Handel and the “Well-Tempered Clavichord” of J. S. Bach. This intimate
study of the best works of the old polyphonic school was of great
advantage later in solidifying his gifts as a musician.</p>
<p><b>First Compositions</b>.—In 1782, were published his first attempts
at composition—a set of variations, and three sonatas; and these,
together with his remarkable extempore playing, began to attract the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
attention of persons of influence. He was appointed organist at Bonn,
and at sixteen was sent by the Elector Max Franz, brother of the
Emperor Joseph II, to Vienna, where he received praise from Mozart, who
predicted a brilliant future for him.</p>
<p><b>The Breuning Family</b>.—In 1787, his mother died; and this loss,
together with his father’s intemperate habits, made his home extremely
unpleasant. Fortunately for Beethoven, however, the enthusiasm for
music which was rife in Germany at this time among people of culture
and position was the cause of attracting to his side many true
friends, who, appreciating his sterling qualities, were able to pardon
his rough exterior and manners. Thus he was received as teacher and
friend into the home of the cultivated von Breuning family, under
whose refining influence he came into touch with the masterpieces of
English and German literature. Here he first met his staunch friend,
Count Waldstein; and here he had leisure for long walks amid the rural
retreats which he heartily loved, and for meditation upon those musical
ideas which he was accustomed to jot down in rough sketches, and which
should later be translated into his immortal creations.</p>
<p><b>In Vienna</b>.—Haydn, passing through Bonn, warmly praised a
cantata of Beethoven’s; and the Elector, moved by such marks of
approbation, sent him again to Vienna, in 1792, for serious study. Here
he was instructed by Haydn till the latter’s departure for England, in
1794, when he went to Albrechtsberger, the celebrated contrapuntist,
and others; but these exponents of an earlier school looked somewhat
askance at the bold innovations which Beethoven introduced into
recognized principles, and failed to understand the irrepressible
genius which prompted them. Nothing daunted, he launched zealously into
composition, supported by a growing circle of admirers to which the
Elector’s patronage had introduced him; and soon became a favorite at
the private soirées of the nobility, where, on account of his eccentric
manners, he was known as an “original,” but where his wonderful
extemporizing was received with ecstasy.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Successes as a Pianist</b>.—Beethoven’s first public performance
in Vienna occurred in 1795, when he performed his pianoforte concerto
in C major at a concert. During a journey soon after, he played before
King Friedrich Wilhelm II, at Berlin, who distinguished him with marks
of favor, and to whom Beethoven dedicated two sonatas written for
pianoforte with ’cello. Here also he met the conductor, <b>Friedrich
Himmel</b> (1765-1814), a pianist and composer of high rank. We hear
next of his trial of pianistic skill with Steibelt, a popular virtuoso,
in which Beethoven won an overwhelming victory. With Wölfl, another
distinguished rival, his relations were those of mutual esteem, and
the two masters delighted to extemporize dashing capriccios on two pianofortes.</p>
<p><b>First Period</b>.—The thirteen years, from 1790 to 1803, are
usually considered to embrace his first period of activity as a
composer, comprising his works to opus 50. His opus 1, three trios for
piano, violin and ’cello, appeared in 1795, and soon after three piano
sonatas, opus 2, dedicated to Haydn, were published. Among the other
noteworthy works of this period were his first two symphonies, in C
and D, three piano concertos, the piano sonatas including opus 27, the
Kreutzer sonata for piano and violin, and his famous Septet for strings
and wind instruments. In general, these compositions <i>follow</i> closely
the lines laid down by <i>Haydn</i> and <i>Mozart</i>, although there is, notably
in the piano sonatas, a gradual tendency toward freedom of expression,
and the assertion of individuality.</p>
<p>Troubles now began to gather about him. About 1800 his hearing became
defective, and the malady grew steadily from bad to worse, so that
by 1816 he was obliged to use an ear-trumpet, and by 1822 he was
stone-deaf. To add to his discomforts, his brothers Karl and Johann
treated him shamefully, and a son of the former, to whom he was left
guardian at the father’s death, and upon whom he lavished a father’s
care, turned out a scapegrace, repaying his affection with the basest
ingratitude. Weighed down by these misfortunes, Beethoven became
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
irritable and morbid, distrusting his most faithful friends, and
constantly imagining plots against himself. His utter ignorance of
worldly matters, too, brought him into financial troubles, and involved
his domestic affairs in a state of continual confusion.</p>
<p><b>Second Period</b>.—Yet, as if to prove man’s ability to rise
superior to every affliction, during this very time he was writing
compositions which, for joyous freshness and spiritual elevation, have
been scarcely, if ever, equalled. During his second period, extending
to 1815, and including his compositions to about opus 90, he adopted a
<i>freedom of expression</i> entirely untrammelled by formal limitations,
enlarging and vivifying the Sonata Form, and varying it to suit his
changing moods. The joy of living, with its intensity of passion
and depths of emotion, is reflected in these works, which assert a
character strong in its struggle against adverse fate, confidently
looking toward the goal of ultimate good.</p>
<p><b>Compositions of this Period</b>.—His most popular symphonies were
written during this period, which embraces those from the third to the
eighth, inclusive. The “Eroica,” number three, was originally written
in homage to Napoleon, whom Beethoven honored as the guide of the
French nation toward that assertion of independence and individuality
which he dearly loved; but when the news arrived that Napoleon was
declared Dictator, in 1804, he tore up the dedicatory page in a fit of
anger. Another of his greatest compositions was his opera of “Fidelio,”
upon which Beethoven spent an amazing amount of time and pains, whose
overture he rewrote twice. Produced in Vienna, in 1805, soon after the
occupation of the city by the French, it was received coldly; and only
after several revisions did it score a success at all in keeping with
its grand and inspiring conception. Several orchestral overtures; his
violin concerto; an oratorio; a mass in C; some of his best chamber
music, including the celebrated Rasumovsky string quartets; and his
piano concertos in G and E-flat, were other fruits of about this time.
Of fourteen piano sonatas, we find several which have continued in
unbroken popularity, notably the two in opus 27, the “Pastorale,” opus
28, the “Waldstein,” opus 53, and the “Appassionata.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Latter Years of His Life</b>.—The latter part of Beethoven’s life,
after 1815, was spent in Vienna, in a state of despondency from his
troubles which his general recognition as the foremost musician of his
day could scarcely alleviate. His many friends placed him, by their
efforts, in comfortable pecuniary circumstances; yet he constantly
imagined himself struggling with poverty. Sensitive to his affliction,
he made himself exceedingly inaccessible, and passed his days in
unceasing labor upon those works which eclipsed, in profundity and
individuality, all of his former compositions, and which were an index
to the conflicting struggles in his mind. Stone-deaf, he yet revelled
in a spiritual world of tone, hearing his greatest compositions only
in the realms of his imagination. An attack of pneumonia in 1826 left
effects which proved lasting, and which caused his death on March 26,
1827. In his last illness he was surrounded by his circle of unfailing
friends, among whom the modest Schubert was admitted; and a proof of
his hold upon his countrymen is shown in the fact that 20,000 persons
are said to have attended his funeral.</p>
<p><b>Last Great Works</b>.—The greatest fruit of these later years was
his last symphony, the Ninth, or “Choral,” in which, for the first
time, he introduced voices as an aid to the instrumental climax. The
free vent which he gave to his radical tendencies in this symphony,
its unheard-of boldness of harmonic progressions, and its defiance of
all conventional rules, aroused a storm of protest from his critics
which was only lulled after succeeding generations had placed the stamp
of unmistakable approval upon the work, and had recognized it as a
monument of genius. Near to this in importance stands his “Solemn Mass”
in D, a work imbued with all the religious fervor of his declining years.</p>
<p><b>Sonatas of Third Period</b>.—Other notable achievements, in the
line of chamber music, mark this period; and the last five piano
sonatas, extending from opus 101 to opus 111, exhibit the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
undaunted freedom that is found in the Ninth symphony. Enormous in
their demands upon the pianist, they are food for none but virtuosi;
but analyzed, they show a <i>compendium of</i> all known <i>musical
resources</i>, from the choral fugue to the most daring flights of
harmonic expression.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven’s Dual Personality</b>.—Beethoven furnishes an example
of a personality whose dual nature is remarkably apparent. Often
unkempt, and rude in his outward bearing, he seemed at times absolutely
oblivious to his surroundings and to chafe at his bodily limitations;
yet his apparent rudeness toward his friends was as often humbly atoned
for by his confession of his haste in judging them. His independence
of spirit could brook no submission to authority other than his own
conscience; and that conscience prompted him to stand firm in support
of the genuine, the pure and the ideal; firm, thus, in its abhorrence
of artificiality and deceit. In his ignorance of worldly wiles he was
on a par with a little child; finding his true sphere when buried in
the lofty problems of his art, giving to the world the fruits of his
innermost spirit, which were ever animated by nobility and truth of expression.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven Stood Alone</b>.—Detesting the fetters of teaching work,
he left few pupils. Among these <b>Ferdinand Ries</b> (1784-1838)
enjoyed an intimate association with him, and afterwards became
prominent as piano virtuoso and composer. With the great men of his day
he affiliated but little. Goethe (1749-1832) he met but once, on one
of his journeys; but the meeting had no further results. Like other
great minds, his original ideas had to make their way amid a shower of
abuse from more conventional contemporaries, who lauded as his equal or
superior others whose works have long since passed into oblivion; but,
fortunate in finding staunch defenders, he made steady progress against
his enemies, until his position in the music world became unique and unassailable.

<h2>LESSON XXXIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and the Sonata</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Bach and Beethoven Contrasted</b>.—We now consider the exact
nature of the work which Beethoven did, in distinction from that of
Haydn and Mozart. It has been said that Bach gave the Old Testament in
music, while Beethoven gave the New; that is, that Bach consummated
the old polyphonic school, while Beethoven did an equal work for
the new harmonic school. Yet this is only a half truth; for Bach,
besides perfecting former styles, gave glimpses of modern chromatic
modulation and free expression; while Beethoven, a student of the old
masters, employed polyphonic forms as well as harmonic, making all
work together to translate his thought, and so moulding them into a
means of portraying every emotion as to open the door forever to the
untrammelled presentment of thought, through the medium of music.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven’s Gradual Development</b>.—But Beethoven did not arrive
at this result in an instant. It is true that, even in his early
works, a distinction of style is shown which removes them from a mere
imitation, but, as has been shown, he <i>began</i> practically at the point
<i>where Haydn and Mozart left off</i>, with compositions which can hardly
be placed on a higher level than theirs; and, in the course of a life
full of strenuous experiences, he gradually <i>unfolded the resources</i>
which he had received from his predecessors, until he made them
adequate to give vent to the mighty ideas which welled from his soul.
Thus we find in his works a period in which <i>form is rigidly observed</i>;
and we pass thence through an era of expansion, during which <i>form
becomes more elastic</i>, through the added requirements placed upon it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
until the thought and emotion become so paramount that the <i>formal
lines</i> have entirely <i>disappeared</i>, and are only to be traced by
careful analysis.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven and the Orchestra</b>.—As the great exponent of
instrumental music, Beethoven found the orchestra his best and fullest
vehicle of expression. So his massive mind, grasping with ease the
effects of manifold combinations of instruments, was able to mould
his thoughts into terms of tone color in which each instrument should
be employed to bring out the exact shade of feeling required. So the
orchestra becomes with him a great individual instrument, responding to
the slightest change of mood.</p>
<p><b>Use of the Piano</b>.—But as a preparation for such orchestral
work, Beethoven realized the value of the pianoforte. Attaining a
marvelous degree of virtuosity in the use of the keyboard at an early
age, he later found this of the greatest advantage in working out his
ideas, and, further, in actually trying their effects upon auditors.
Thus we find in his first pianoforte sonatas effects which appeared
much later in the greater elaboration of his symphonies; thus also is
shown the necessary imperfection of any division of his works into
distinct periods, since his pianoforte style was so greatly in advance
of his orchestral.</p>
<p><b>Improvement in the Piano</b>.—In this connection, it is important
to note that Beethoven’s resources were greatly increased by the
improvements which had been made in piano manufacture. The demand for
instruments, created by the growing popularity of the pianoforte,
stimulated manufacturers to redoubled energy in perfecting them; and,
conversely, the added resources thus developed were an instigation to
composers to test their abilities in the invention of new effects. Thus
Beethoven was placed in command of a piano of much greater power than
Mozart’s; and the work of technicians, like Clementi, for whom he had
great respect, was already hinting at new and marvelous possibilities.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Added Sonority and Sustaining Power</b>.—This strength of
construction resulted in greater sonority. Hence we find full chord
progressions and rich floods of tone in Beethoven’s works, in place
of the dainty harmonic accompaniment of former writers. Moreover,
the increase in sustaining force, enhanced by the use of the
pedal, made possible a sustained legato tone for singing passages,
which had formerly to be merely hinted at through shakes and other
embellishments. A consequent tone variety made it possible to emphasize
a single voice in this way, while the accompanying harmonies could
be kept well in the background. Again, this range of tone proved an
incentive for long crescendos, from the softest suspicion of sound to
an overwhelming tonal climax.</p>
<p><b>Increased Compass</b>.—The added range which the keyboard developed
also enhanced such effects, by the chance for brilliancy in the treble,
and for profundity in the bass; moreover, Beethoven was quick to make
use of the variety of effects caused by <i>playing in the different
registers</i>; sometimes suggesting in this way the contrast in the
orchestra between different groups of instruments, such as the strings
and woodwind.</p>
<p><b>Structure of Beethoven’s Sonatas</b>.—With such resources at his
command, Beethoven was able to give a fuller scope to the Sonata than
was formerly possible, filling out each movement, and perfecting it for
the expression of an integral part of the general idea, and finally
placing it in its proper relationship to the whole. The Sonata Form,
as settled by Haydn, was made the point of departure, serving almost
invariably as the basis of the first movement, and frequently, in
shortened form, for the second, generally slow, movement. For the third
movement, Beethoven at first employed the Minuet, following the custom
in the symphonies of Haydn and Mozart; but later this was generally
omitted in the pianoforte sonatas, while in the symphonies its time was
quickened into that of the dainty, sparkling Scherzo. For the finale,
the Rondo form was most frequent; though, in order to give a fuller
compass to the thought, a combination of the Rondo and Sonata forms was
invented by Beethoven, and used even in his first sonatas. The Rondo
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
form also appeared occasionally in the slow movement. Add that other
forms, notably that of the Variation, sometimes supplanted one or
the other of these, and we have the structure generally followed by Beethoven.</p>
<p><b>Unity of Conception</b>.—All these movements were associated in an
organic unity of conception which made one grow out of another with
perfect naturalness. Sometimes, indeed, as in opus 27, a continuity of
performance was indicated; always, however, the feeling of dependence
of one movement upon another is present; so that the criticism made
upon Haydn’s symphonies, that a movement of one could be interchanged
with a similar movement of any other without perceptible difference,
could never be made with regard to Beethoven’s works.</p>
<p><b>Key Relationship</b>.—In key relationship, Beethoven struck out
from stereotyped paths, frequently using <i>contrasting keys related to
the third of the initial chord</i>; thus a movement or passage in C major
might be followed by any key related to E, the third of the chord of
C, such as E or A major or minor. The original key was most widely
departed from in the slow movement, where the beauty of contrast was
exceptionally noticeable.</p>
<p><b>Number of Movements</b>.—The number of movements which he adopted
was at first four, but this afterwards varied considerably, two
or three movements prevailing; while in the fantasie-sonatas, and
especially in the last five sonatas, an indefinite number of movements,
some of them very short, appeared. He explained this discrepancy on the
ground that he adapted the number of movements to his thought; and when
he felt that he had given complete expression to this, the sonata was
brought to a close.</p>
<p><b>Development of First Movement Form</b>.—Of Beethoven’s first
movements, it may be said that no one has ever spoken with the perfect
freedom and naturalness which he displays. Each part of the movement
he strengthened and developed; the first section announced two themes,
contrasting, but still closely identified; sometimes with a slow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
introduction to usher them in; the Development was given a contrapuntal
treatment, solidified by rich harmonies; the third section was varied
by rhythmic or tonal devices, tending to broaden its effect; and,
finally, the Coda was sometimes developed to the length of a fourth
section, in which reminiscences of material used previously were worked
up to a fitting climax.</p>
<p><b>Devices for Giving Unity</b>.—But the most evident characteristic
which Beethoven put into this form was that of <i>Unity</i>, or <i>Continuity
of idea</i>. This he accomplished by several means. Of these, the first
was by separating the most striking parts of his subjects into short,
definite phrases or motives, and by introducing these in every variety
of manner throughout the movement, sometimes in a sequence on different
degrees of the scale, sometimes by imitation in different voices, again
by varying the length of the component notes, and finally by dropping
off portions, while the portions remaining keep the idea still before
the auditor. Or, some casual phrase, in an unimportant section, will
strike his fancy and he will develop it with a wealth of imagery
astonishing in its inventiveness.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a></p>
<p><b>Continuity of Various Parts</b>.—This constant presentment of a
thematic idea also serves to bind passages closely together which, in
the sonatas of Haydn and Mozart, were separated by definite pauses.
Indeed, Beethoven sedulously <i>avoids a complete cadence</i>, seeking, by
leading the listener eagerly on from one connecting phrase to another,
to retain the interest and make it mount up higher and higher, as the
effects grow in intensity. So phrases are made to overlap one another,
with their boundaries practically eliminated. It has been said that
Beethoven tore down the fences which Haydn and Mozart had erected
between the various parts of the Sonata Form; and this is proven by the
fact that, in the Beethoven sonatas, authorities frequently differ as
to where one part ends and another begins, so close and continuous is
the bond between them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Dramatic Effects in Climaxes</b>.—This close connection is made
a ready element toward the dramatic expression which finds vent in
the climaxes, made from culminating tonal effects, where the thematic
phrase mounts up step by step, higher and higher, growing breathless by
shortened rhythm, until the hearer is brought to the summit of dramatic
intensity; and here thunderous arpeggios, mingled together by the use
of the pedal, hold him spellbound with their sonorous waves of sound.
The supreme passion which Beethoven does not wholly conceal even in
his quieter moods appears frequently in strange, agitated rhythms and
startling accents thrown upon unexpected notes or in unexpected places.
He also used many more marks of expression than his predecessors.</p>
<p><b>Freedom in Modulations</b>.—The boldness of his modulations has
already been mentioned; and these appear with the most freedom in the
development sections, where tonalities pile upon one another, until the
auditor is apparently inextricably involved in a maze of harmonies;
from which, naturally as the awakening from a dream, he finds himself
transported back to the original key, in which the first theme is
taking its course. Beethoven’s sense of proportion, however, sees to it
that this intricacy of keys is well prepared by the definite tonality
of his original subjects, and by the final complete restatement of the
original key. His harmonies frequently shocked his contemporaries by
their violations of conventional rules; but they have long since been
justified by succeeding musicians, who have departed from them to much
bolder flights.</p>
<p><b>Program Music</b>.—It has been said that Beethoven furnishes
examples of the program style—that is, the depicting of definite ideas
through music. We have already found a tendency of this sort among the
early French clavier composers—Rameau, the Couperins and others of
their school; also in some of the German writers, like Pachelbel and
Kuhnau. Viewed in relation to these early composers, Beethoven’s work
seems to have little in common, since his nearest approach to program
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
music was in attaching to some of his works certain moods, inspired
by events or scenes. Thus he gives the name “Pathétique” to the
sonata, opus 13, “Appassionata” to opus 57, “Les Adieux” to opus 81;
while we have the “Pastoral” symphony, depicting the mood inspired by
country scenes, and the “Eroica,” showing the mood arising from the
contemplation of a hero’s career.</p>
<p><b>Pianoforte Concertos</b>.—The same characteristics which are noted
in his pianoforte sonatas appeared, developed still further, in his
larger works, such as his symphonies and piano concertos. The latter,
five in number, display the resources of the virtuosity of Beethoven’s
day, and yet keep this always subordinated to the inspired musical
sentiment, with which the orchestra nobly accords. The last two of
these, belonging to the maturity of his genius, amply display the
powers of genuine expression.</p>
<p><b>Variations</b>.—Of numerous other piano compositions, the sets of
Variations are prominent. He was fond of taking some short and simply
constructed musical thought, sometimes from some song or opera, and
treating it in every variety of manner that his fertile genius could
suggest. Such compositions, while generally playful in mood, have the
finish which Beethoven never failed to give to his work.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven’s Accuracy in Writing</b>.—It is this seriousness toward
his art which most fully accentuates the real underlying drift of his
nature. In the midst of his untidy ménage, when confusion of material
goods reigned about him, Beethoven nevertheless treated each work
which flowed from his pen with the most careful and critical revision,
never allowing it to go out until he had absolutely fixed each note in
its proper place. Where his art was involved, his usually irritable
nature acquired a fund of patience; so that sometimes whole scores were
rewritten, until he arrived at accurate expression; and, when that
point was reached, his fiat was irrevocable. It is thus a satisfaction
to note that he has not left us the erratic wanderings of an eccentric
mind; but the completed and matured product of a genius, speaking with
authority and precision.

<h2>LESSON XXXIV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Violin and its Makers</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Change from the Viol to the Violin</b>.—The reader who has
studied the principles of construction and playing of the old string
instruments, as explained in Lesson XV, or examined them in museums,
will not have failed to note that they were complicated and limited
in technic. The members of this family were large and cumbersome,
troublesome to handle and not particularly graceful or pleasing to
the eye; the position in which the player was forced to hold them was
difficult to maintain and not conducive to a rapid, facile technic.
Now, the direction of a perfected art is always toward simplicity;
the various members of the viol family were to yield place to a new
instrument, a modification of the original type, and one that possessed
some striking and valuable advantages over the viol. Another element
that aided in the change from the viol was the efforts of composers
to produce a distinctive instrumental music, a style which demanded
an instrument with a higher range than the viols, corresponding to
the highest female voice. Still another element to be considered
was the stir in intellectual, social, political and commercial life
which was evident everywhere, the product of the Renaissance. Music
was influenced by this spirit; composers were seeking new forms in
which to express their thoughts and were calling for new and better
media for presenting them to others. As composers gained in breadth
and power of conception, instruments were improved even beyond their
demands; the increase in resources stimulated, in turn, the composers.
At this period music was on the threshold of a splendid activity
in instrumental lines, the reign of the old choral music and the
contrapuntal composer was being challenged, and the way prepared for
Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Beginning of the Violin</b>.—With regard to the violin, as in
other beginnings, there is disagreement; the strongest claims are set
forth for France and Italy, with German historians by no means lax
in attributing the first instruments to one of their own countrymen.
We give the following facts which seem to divide the honors: In the
scores of Italian works of the 16th century, a part may be found for
what is called the <i>piccolo violino alla francese</i> (little French
viol), a fact which would argue that an instrument of this kind,
perhaps most commonly used in France, had been known for some time.
The oldest known instrument of the violin type is one which bears the
date 1449, and is signed Jean Kerlin, a Breton luthier (lute maker,
a term applied also to violin makers), whose name is also given as
Kerlino, living in Brescia, Italy, in the middle of the 15th century.
About the same time there lived in Bologna, Padua and Venice, members
of a celebrated lute-making family, named Duiffoprugcar, Italian
equivalent for the German name, Tieffenbrucker, for the family came
from the Italian Tyrol. The most celebrated member of this family was
Gasparo Duiffoprugcar (Casper Tieffenbrucker), who was born about 1469,
lived in Bologna until 1515, when he went to Paris. Later he removed
to Lyons, where he spent the rest of his life. Six instruments having
violin characteristics (high, not sloping shoulders, deeper curves in
the waist and better-defined  <i>f</i>  holes) are attributed
to him, bearing dates of 1510, 1511, 1515 and 1517.</p>
<p><b>Early Italian Makers</b>.—The next name is that of Gasparo di Salo,
founder of the Brescian school of violin-making, who was born at a
little village called Salo, on Lake Garda; hence his name. His model
varied, sometimes it was high, at other times flat; as his instruments
produced a full, sonorous tone, the model was revived in later years
by Joseph Guarnerius. His tenors and double-basses are considered his
finest work, his violins being a trifle small. The favorite double bass
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of Dragonetti, the famous contrabassist, was by di Salo; Ole Bull
frequently played on a di Salo violin in his concerts. The greatest
successor of di Salo was his pupil, <b>Giovanni Paolo Maggini</b>
(1590-1640), whose violins are highly prized. They are characterized by
a brown varnish and a double purfling.</p>
<p><b>The Cremona School</b>.—With the public the name Cremona is
indissolubly connected with violin-making. In the 16th century this
city was a famous art centre, rivaling Bologna in music and painting.
The first great maker and founder of the Cremona school was Andrea
(Andrew) Amati, born about 1520 and died 1577 or 1580.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a>
He used mostly a small pattern, top and back high, the varnish amber in
color. A number of his instruments furnished for the Chapel Royal of
Charles IX were known to have been in Versailles prior to the French
Revolution. The Amati style was continued by Andrea’s two sons, Antonio
(Anthony) and Hieronymus (Geronimo or Jerome) Amati. The former is said
to have lived 1550-1638, the latter 1551-1635. They worked conjointly,
although the latter made some experiments with a larger model than the
usual Amati.</p>
<p><b>Nicolo Amati</b>.—The greatest of the Amati family and the one
whose instruments are still highly prized was <b>Nicolo (Nicolaus)
Amati</b> (1596-1684), the son of Geronimo. He forms one of the great
triumvirate of violin-making, Amati, Guarnerius and Stradivarius. At
first he followed the small form adopted by his father and his uncle,
although he improved on the workmanship. But about 1625, no doubt as
the result of an experiment, he began to use a slightly larger pattern
which is known to connoisseurs as the “Grand Amati.” These instruments
represent his best work and command a high price. The Amati tone is
sweet, mellow yet somewhat delicate, although remarkable in purity;
the instruments are unsuited to orchestral work, although admirable in
chamber music, particularly of the old style. The varnish is yellowish
or amber colored.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Joseph Guarnerius</b>.—In our study of the piano we noted how
the small, weak tone of the clavichord and harpsichord gave way
before the fuller toned, sonorous pianoforte, which, with its greater
possibilities, came into use at a time when composers were seeking
for means to give increased breadth and power to the reproduction
of their music. It would have been unfortunate for instrumental
music if the small though sweet tone of the Amati violin had been
accepted as the ideal. We could not have had the surging tumult of
Beethoven’s “Eroica” symphony, the great dramatic pictures of Wagner
with the Amati to lay on the colors. More tone, more sonorousness,
more virile singing was needed. One of the men to place in the hands
of executants the instrument to work out the conceptions of the
great composers was <b>Giuseppe Guarneri</b> or, as he is generally
called, Joseph Guarnerius del Gesu. He was born at Cremona, 1683, and
belonged to a family of lute and violin makers. He has been credited
with having been a pupil of Stradivari, yet his instruments show no
trace of that maker’s influence. He seems to have been impressed with
the tone-producing qualities of the di Salo violins, for his best
instruments have something of their bold, vigorous style. He was an
experimenter, ever seeking, it would seem, for the means of producing
big, sonorous tone, and changed his model frequently, for which reason
his instruments vary much in value. His work was not so highly favored
by connoisseurs until Paganini showed the value of a Guarnerius from
the standpoint of tone. His best instruments are now greatly admired
and, because so few in good condition are known, command a high price.
The date of Guarnerius’ death is not known. Others of the Guarnerius
family who lived and worked at Cremona were Andreas Guarnerius, uncle
to Giuseppe, his son also called Joseph and known as “<i>filius Andreæ</i>”
(Son of Andreas) to distinguish him from his cousin, Joseph del Gesu,
another son Peter, “of Cremona,” and a son of Joseph <i>filius Andreæ</i>,
known as Peter of Venice.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Antonius Stradivarius</b>.—The greatest of violin-makers who united
in his instruments the brilliant and powerful tone of di Salo and the
Brescian school and the purity and finish of the Amati was <b>Antonius
Stradivarius</b> (Antonio Stradivari is the Italian form), born in
1644, one year after the death of Monteverde, and died in 1737, five
years after the birth of Haydn, a period of nearly a century in which
a most significant development took place in music. He was apprenticed
to Nicolo Amati, and the instruments of his early years are faithful
copies of that master’s work; but as he grew in years and experience
he improved on the Amati model, every change tending to produce a
more powerful and resonant tone. The differences that strike the eye
most strongly are the larger proportions, the flatter arch of the
top, and the shape of the sound holes. In his earlier instruments
he used a yellowish varnish; after 1684, one of a reddish tint.
Stradivarius also fixed the form and adjustment of the bridge. He left
two sons, Francesco and Omoboni, who finished some of their father’s
instruments after his death. They both died five or six years later.
Pupils of Stradivarius who made excellent instruments were <b>Carlo
Bergonzi</b> (1712-1750), <b>Lorenzo Guadagnini</b> (1695-1740) and his
son <b>Johannes Baptista Guadagnini</b> (1750-1785) and <b>Alessandro Gagliano</b>.</p>
<p><b>Other Makers</b>.—Germany’s contribution to violin-making dates
from <b>Jakob Stainer</b>, of Absam in Tyrol (1621-1683). Tradition
has it that he learned his art at Cremona; if so, his work shows no
influence of the Amati; his model is different, somewhat broader
and shorter, the arch of the belly is greater, and the sound holes
are set differently; the varnish varies from a brown to an amber
color; the tone is sweet and quick to respond, but lacks intensity.
A follower of Stainer was <b>Ægidius Klotz</b> (1653-1743), many of
whose instruments were sold as of Stainer’s make. France contributed
no makers of great renown. The names of importance are <b>Nicholas
Lupot</b> (1758-1824), a follower of Stradivarius, and <b>J. B.
Vuillaume</b> (1799-1875). In England the most distinguished names are
<b>Richard Duke</b> and <b>Benjamin Banks</b> (1727-1795).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Violin Bow</b>.—A few words must be said in regard to the bow,
the means for producing tone from the violin strings. In its earliest
form it was simply a bow with a stretched string. Hair came into use,
to replace the string, about the 13th century, and the bow lost its
original shape, becoming straight for nearly its entire length, curving
downward at the point. Corelli used a bow of this shape. Tartini’s
bow had the same shape, but was made longer. At the end of the 18th
century, <b>François Tourte</b> (1747-1835), a Paris bow-maker,
lengthened the bow still more, and bent it slightly inward, giving it
the form familiar to us today. Viotti was the first great player to use
this style of bow, and is credited with a share in perfecting it. It is
no exaggeration to say that upon Tourte’s improvements to the bow rests
the whole fabric of modern violin-playing, with its wonderful variety
of execution and consequent nuances in expression.</p>
<p><b>The Viola and the Violoncello</b>.—Two other instruments of
the violin type are in use, the Viola, the <i>tenor</i> violin, and the
Violoncello, the <i>bass</i> violin; both these instruments shared in
the development of the violin, and were made by the great makers,
Amati, Guarnerius and Stradivarius. The Contra-bass, the bass-viol,
as it is often called, while it is used to furnish the bass to the
string orchestra, is a member of the viol family, having the special
characteristics, sloping shoulders and flat back. Instruments were made
on the violin pattern, but given up as less satisfactory than the viol type.</p>
<p>The impetus given to instrumental composition by the perfecting of
the instruments of the string group stimulated makers to work for
improvement in those belonging to the family of wind instruments,
flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns, harps, etc., thus offering the means
to reproduce for hearers the great conceptions of the tone-masters.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Violin Playing and Violin Music</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Reciprocal Influences of Instruments and Composition</b>.—The
development of the violin, of violin playing and violin music, in a
certain sense shows reciprocal influences, and went hand in hand.
This was the more certain because the composers who wrote for the
instrument were also players, in almost every instance the virtuosi of
their times. During the polyphonic period, composers were singers or
organists; during the period when the violin dominated instrumental
composition, composers in that form were usually violinists. In
the next period, when the pianoforte was coming to the front, the
representative composers were clavier composers. And since then with
but few exceptions the great composers have also been pianists.</p>
<p><b>Earliest Violin Compositions</b>.—In the music of the viol period
no demands were made upon the instrumental player except that he should
double the voice part, which was simple, viewed from the standpoint of
modern violin playing. Even later when music was written for quartets
of viols the parts were vocal in character and did not exceed voices
in range. The earliest known solo composition was published in 1620,
by Marini. It demands but little from the executant. The next work
of importance was in 1627, when Carlo Farina, an Italian living at
Dresden, published a collection of pieces which show quite an advance
technically, including variety of bowing, double stopping and chords.
The names applied to violin compositions were: <i>Sonate</i>, <i>Canzone</i> and
<i>Sinfonia</i>, the principle of the first named being an alternation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
slow and quick movements. About 1650 the term Sonata comes into general
use, and a further distinction is made between <i>Sonata da Chiesa</i>
(church sonata) and <i>Sonata da Camera</i> (chamber sonata), the former
consisting of three or four movements varying in tempo, the latter
being really a suite of dances, with slow and quick movements in
alternation. The Church, always ready to make use of the fine arts,
soon discovered the capabilities of the violin and its music, and
adopted it as one of its musical forces, not merely for assisting in
accompaniments but for independent performances. As a result of this
patronage, the violin sonata, the only form of serious composition for
the instrument, took on the severer character of the church sonata,
giving an impulse toward the establishment of sonata form.</p>
<p><b>Composers of the 17th Century</b>.—Among those who prepared the
way for the great ones to follow was <b>Giovanni Battista Vitali</b>
(1644-1692), who shows in his chamber sonatas the tendency to adopt the
form of the church sonata. His name is best known in violin literature
by a Chaconne with variations, which makes no inconsiderable demands on
the technic of a player, and must have marked him out as a conspicuous
player in his own time. This is a worthy forerunner of Bach’s great
work in a similar form. In Germany the significant name is <b>Heinrich
Biber</b> (1644-1704), who had a highly developed technic for that
period, for his works carry the player up to the sixth position and
introduce difficult double stopping and arpeggios. The next name to be
noticed is <b>Giuseppe Torelli</b> (1660-1708), who lived many years
in Bologna as leader of a church orchestra. He is credited with having
been the first to apply the principles of construction as shown in
the church sonata to concerted music, which later developed into the Concerto.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Arcangelo Corelli</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Corelli</b>.—In any great movement one man seems to sum up the
best of the work of his predecessors. The name associated with putting
violin music and playing on a firm foundation is that of <b>Arcangelo
Corelli</b> (1653-1713), eminent both as composer and player. He
was a contemporary of Guarnerius and Stradivarius, who brought the
instrument to perfection. Of Corelli’s early life little is known. He
traveled in France and was also in Munich for some years. In 1681 he
returned to Italy, making his home at Rome. As a teacher, he acquired
great fame and pupils came to him from all parts of Europe. The most
eminent violinists who were under his instruction were Geminiani,
Locatelli, Somis, Baptiste, and Castrucci. Corelli did not invent new
forms of composition or of technic—in the latter respect he did not
equal certain of his contemporaries—he was a reformer rather than
an innovator. He had, however, a keen sense for effects that were
specially suited to the instrument, and his conservatism put the art
of playing the violin on a solid basis upon which others were able to
add newer and more difficult technic. His works included forty-eight
three-part sonatas for various combinations, twelve two-part sonatas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
for violin and cembalo, nine for two violins and cembalo, and six
concertos for two violins and ’cello with a quartet accompaniment.
The violin being so preëminently a singing, a melody instrument, it
is singular that Corelli and his contemporaries did not grasp the
principle of using clearly defined melodic themes. This fact shows that
the influence of the church sonata and its rejection of a formal tune
as unsuited to serious art was still strong. Therefore, while Corelli’s
works do not show themes such as are characteristic of the next period
of the sonata, his construction is logical and his handling of his
form-material is concise and clear. The student of Form in music will
find the germs of sonata-form in Corelli’s works.</p>
<p><b>Corelli’s Pupils</b>.—Among Corelli’s pupils must be mentioned
<b>Francesco Geminiani</b> (1680-1762), who spent part of his life
in England. He published the first work of a pedagogic character, a
“Method for Violin Playing,” in London, in 1740. He also recommended
holding the violin on the left side instead of on the right, as was
customary in his time. <b>Pietro Locatelli</b> (1693-1764) greatly
influenced the development of violin technic. <b>Giovanni Battista
Somis</b> (1676-1763) lived at Turin, was the teacher of Pugnani,
the instructor of Viotti. <b>Antonio Vivaldi</b> (1675-1743) devoted
himself to virtuosity and influenced the Concerto from this point. He
was fertile and ingenious in making new combinations and devising new
effects. J. S. Bach arranged his works, sixteen for the clavier, four
for the organ, and one as a concerto for four claviers and a quartet
of stringed instruments. Still another name is to be mentioned, that
of <b>Francesco Maria Veracini</b> (1685-1750), who greatly influenced
Tartini by his playing. He was a player full of temperament, which made
his playing powerfully expressive. His sonatas are bold in harmonic and
melodic treatment, and well constructed. Their technical difficulty is
considerable. (His lifetime coincides with Bach.)

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Giuseppe Tartini</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Giuseppe Tartini</b> (1692-1770) is one of the commanding figures
of musical history. He was intended for the profession of law by his
parents but, fortunately for music, did not fall in with the plan.
A hasty marriage with the niece of an archbishop brought him into
trouble, and he fled to a monastery, where he spent two years, devoting
the greater part of his time to musical studies. At the end of this
time he was allowed to rejoin his wife, and went to Venice, where he
learned to know Veracini, with whom he studied to correct the faults
he had acquired through pursuing his studies undirected. Again he went
into retirement and gave himself up to the study of violin technic.
Among other things he made some improvements in the bow, increasing
the range of effects. His contemporaries ascribe to him “a fine tone,
unlimited command of fingerboard and bow, perfect intonation in double
stops, a most brilliant trill and double trill as well, which he could
execute equally well with all fingers.” His celebrated composition
“<i>Il Trillo del Diavolo</i>” (“The Devil’s Trill”) shows his skill in
embellishments. A technical work “<i>Arte dell’ Arco</i>” (“The Art of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Bowing”) gives a clear idea of his method in that branch of the
violinist’s art. In his compositions he shows advance on Corelli and
Vivaldi, for his melody is broader, his phrases more developed and
clearer, his harmonies richer and better contrasted, with many passages
of a strongly emotional character. He wrote a great number of pieces,
sonatas and concertos. In addition to his work as player and composer,
Tartini devoted himself to teaching. His school at Padua was the Mecca
of violinists from all Europe. In those days there were no instruction
books; Tartini’s pupils looked to him for everything, and his character
as a teacher can be learned in a letter addressed by him to a pupil.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a>
Tartini’s contribution to music also includes work of a theoretical
character. He discovered the so-called combinational sound, by which
is meant the sounding of a third sound when two tones are sounded
together.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a>
He published a treatise on the subject. Two pupils of Tartini’s who
deserve mention are <b>Pietro Nardini</b> (1722-1793) and <b>Gaetano
Pugnani</b> (1726-1803), who was also a pupil of Somis, thus uniting in
himself the teachings of the two great masters, Tartini and Corelli,
which he transmitted to later generations through his great pupil, Viotti.</p>
<p>With Tartini the violin sonata of the old type lost its place, being
succeeded by the sonata for the piano which was being developed by
composers, giving rise to a form that was later to be the basis of
a new sonata for violin and piano in which each instrument filled
an equal place. In the earlier days the tone of the clavichord and
harpsichord, weak and thin, was not suited save for accompanying the
full-toned brilliantly effective violin; but after Tartini’s time
the instrument gained in power and sonorousness and formed a worthy
helpmeet for the violin.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Giovanni Battista Viotti</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Violin playing in France</b> was largely influenced by Italian
players. Lully, the opera composer, was a violinist, but the Italian
school had not developed when, as a lad, he left his native country.
The Corelli principles were carried to France by <b>Leclair</b>
(1687-1764), who received his training from Somis, a pupil of Corelli.
His treatment of the bow showed the lightness and agility that later
became distinctive of the French school. <b>Pierre Gaviniés</b>
(1726-1800) lent strength to the establishment of an independent
French school of playing. He is best known today by a set of difficult
studies. <b>Giovanni Battista Viotti</b> (1753-1824), an Italian by
birth, greatly influenced violin playing in his day. As a lad of
seventeen he traveled through Europe with Pugnani, his teacher, winning
great success. Later he located in Paris, teaching and composing,
giving regularly private performances at which he brought out his
concertos. His themes have a marked singing character, and all his
writing is eminently suited to the instrument. In his concertos he used
the elaborated sonata-form as developed by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven,
and in his accompaniments draws fully on the resources of the
orchestra. His works include a fine set of duets for two violins. His
most eminent pupils were <b>Pierre Rode</b> (1774-1830) and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
<b>Pierre Marie François de Sales Baillot</b> (1771-1842) who with <b>Rodolphe
Kreutzer</b> (1766-1831) were teachers in the Paris Conservatoire,
for which they prepared the famous “Méthode de Violin.” Rode and
Kreutzer are famous in violin literature for their studies for advanced
players. Beethoven dedicated his great sonata for piano and violin,
Op. 47, to Kreutzer, for which reason it is known by the latter’s
name. In connection with the educational writers just mentioned,
<b>Federigo Fiorillo</b>, born 1753, in Germany, of Italian parents,
is to be noted. His thirty-six etudes or caprices rank with the works
of Rode and Kreutzer. <b>Antonio Lolli</b> (1730-1802) was a virtuoso
and nothing else. His execution was marvelous, and he was, in many
respects, a forerunner of Paganini.</p>
<p><b>Violin playing in Germany</b> had its source and inspiration in
the concert tours made in that country by the great Italian virtuosi,
a number of whom lived for periods of some length at the courts of
Berlin, Dresden, Mannheim and other capitals, where they trained pupils
for the various ducal orchestras. The orchestra at Mannheim was the
most famous for its work and sent out a number of fine players and
musicians. Space does not permit the mention of these men. The first
great name in the violin world of Germany is <b>Ludwig Spohr</b>
(1784-1859), who was also one of the great composers of his time, his
activity leading him into the domain of the oratorio and opera as
well as orchestra and instrumental music. (His principal teacher was
<b>Franz Eck</b> (1774-1804), who belonged to the Mannheim school.)
Later he had opportunity to hear Rode, by whose playing he was much
impressed. He spent some years in concertizing, and in 1822 located
at Cassel as the director of the orchestra there. Here he taught many
noted pupils, the best known being Ferdinand David. While Spohr was a
great player and a great teacher, he influenced modern violin playing
more by his compositions. Some of his concertos still figure in the
violinist’s repertoire and his duos and concertantes for two violins
and for violin and viola are unsurpassed by any compositions in that
style. In 1831, he published his “Violin School,” which was a standard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
work for many years. The direct successor of Spohr was <b>Ferdinand
David</b> (1810-1873), a great player and a great teacher who was
associated with Mendelssohn in the founding of the famous Leipzig
Conservatorium. From this institution David’s pupils went over all
Europe into positions of responsibility and reputation. His greatest
pupil was <b>August Wilhelmj</b> (b. 1845). After David’s death
supremacy in the field of violin playing gradually fell away from
Leipzig and centred in Berlin around Joseph Joachim, the Nestor of the
present-day<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a>

<p class="space-below2"><b>The Vienna School</b>.—The southern Germans had
certain characteristics wherein they differed from their northern kin; they
were in closer touch with Italy and were also influenced by their
Hungarian neighbors. In Beethoven’s time considerable attention
was given by Viennese violinists to chamber-music. Four names are
prominent: <b>Karl Dittersdorf</b> (1739-1799), <b>Anton Wranitzky</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
(1756-1808), <b>Joseph Mayseder</b> (1789-1863) and <b>Joseph Bœhm</b>
(1795-1876), the latter being the teacher of a number of famous
violinists, <b>Hellmesberger</b>, <b>Dont</b>, <b>Remenyi</b>,
<b>Ernst</b> and <b>Joseph Joachim</b> (b. 1831), the latter,
representing the solid, classical style of his teacher, joined to a
mastery of the technic of his instrument that enabled him to win and
maintain the highest rank as virtuoso, quartet player and composer
for his instrument. Up to the time of his death, August 15, 1907, he
was director of the Royal High School of Music in Berlin. He was the
teacher of hundreds of players, including many celebrated artists of
the present day.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Paganini</b>.—The most unique, most startling figure in music
belongs to the violin, a law unto himself in his playing, one for
whom the violin seemed to have been perfected long years before by
Guarnerius and Stradivarius and one who seemed to have been made for
the violin, the hero of fictions innumerable, to whom was attributed in
his day all manner of occult power. This mysterious king of the violin
was <b>Nicolo Paganini</b>, born in Genoa, February 18, 1782, died May
27, 1840. Never strong in body, in his early youth he gave himself up
to dissipation to such an extent that he undermined his constitution,
and passed through the world as a spectre rather than as a man.
Paganini was self-developed, he belonged to no school and he founded
none, yet so great was his command of the technic of the violin and
the bow, that no other player so profoundly influenced contemporaries
and successors on the matter of virtuosity. He taught but one pupil,
<b>Camille Sivori</b> (1815-1894). Paganini greatly influenced the
younger French violinists of his day, among whom may be mentioned
<b>Alard</b> and <b>Dancla</b>. After these men come <b>Charles de
Bériot</b> (1802-1870), who represents the Belgian School, his pupil
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<b>Henri Vieuxtemps</b> (1820-1881) and third generation in the line
of pupilage, <b>Eugen Ysaye</b> (b. 1858). Others who belong to the
Belgian School are <b>Massart</b> (teacher of <b>Wieniawski</b>,
<b>Kreisler</b> and others), <b>Léonard</b> (teacher of <b>César
Thomson</b>, <b>Marsick</b>, <b>Musin</b>, <b>Marteau</b>, etc.).
At the present time the centre of interest in the violin world has
shifted to Prague, where <b>Ottokar Ševčík</b> has sent out young
violinists of the Slav race who display the most astonishing technical mastery.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Orchestra and Absolute Music</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Orchestra as a Means of Expression</b>.—The most perfect means
for expression in music is presented by the orchestra, which, in its
complete form as shown today, is the result of a long development in
many directions. To give us this magnificent mass-instrument required a
sifting of the various instruments and the choice of those that offered
the best possibilities, a perfecting of these instruments, a shaping of
systems of playing them, of technic that should draw out all possible
effects, and an understanding, on the part of composers, of the nature
and demands of absolute music and how best to shape their conceptions
in accordance with these demands. The orchestra and its music,
therefore, represents the extreme height of man’s work in music, for
even when choral forces are joined to the orchestra, the instrumental
idea dominates, as, for example, in the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven, in
which the chorus is simply a <i>vocal band</i> added to the other groups.
The orchestra is a great means for musical expression because it
offers to the composer the maximum of resources. In modern days, when
the esthetic principle of Unity in Variety receives the most elastic
interpretation due to the demand for the greatest possible contrasts
in tone-color, power and in nuances, all, however, intended to exhibit
and illumine the themes invented by the composer in their various
transformations, in these days the orchestra is truly the most complete art-means known.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Groups in the Orchestra</b>.—The orchestra is composed of groups
of instruments allied by similarity of construction. The usual
classification is into three main groups, <b>strings</b>, (bowed
instruments), <b>wind</b> and <b>percussion</b> instruments. In the
former are included the violins, viola, violoncello and double or
contra-bass; <b>wind</b> instruments subordinate into <b>wood wind</b>
and <b>brass</b>, the former include instruments of the flute, oboe,
bassoon and clarinet families, the latter horns, trumpets, trombones,
tuba or other bass instruments; the <b>percussion</b> includes kettle
drums, other drums, triangles, cymbals, etc.; the <b>harp</b>,
while a stringed instrument, is not included in that class. These
instruments offer a great variety of effects, singly and in many
possible combinations, in the peculiar effects possible by variety in
playing, which in bowed instruments is considerable, and particularly
by contrast with each other. While the orchestra today is in a highly
developed condition, composers are seeking to extend the limits of
their art by the use of more elaborate and subtle forms; so that we
cannot in any wise predict the course and limits of absolute music with
the almost unlimited resources at its disposal in the modern orchestra.</p>
<p><b>Purpose in Combination</b>.—When we consider the orchestra
as a combination of instruments we must bear in mind that this
combination is the result of a definite purpose to produce music
independent of restrictions such as were shown to have existed in
the days of the domination of the Church. The composers of the early
polyphonic period and up to the 17th century bent their efforts to
the composition of choral music which was sung for many years without
instrumental support. When later the organ, and still later, viols
and other instruments were drafted into the service of church music,
the accompaniments were not independent of the voice, but merely
doubled the various parts. Composers thought in <i>terms of voices</i>
and their limitations, <i>not in</i> the greater range and endurance of
<i>instruments</i>. Then, too, the instruments were crude and their tone
lacked distinctiveness as well as the comparative sweetness and purity
of the vocal music of that day. Combinations of instruments existed in
the Middle Ages, but not according to a system, and were due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
executants who assembled them rather than to the demand for them in the
works of composers. It was in the attempts at light dramatic music that
preceded the establishment of the opera that instruments were grouped
together, showing a great weakness, from our point of view, in stringed
instruments played with the bow, and a corresponding preponderance of brass.</p>
<p><b>Influence of the Opera</b>.—The first composers of opera and
oratorio gave instrumental support to the singers, although it was
very meager. Yet the opera gave the help of that great principle of
invention, necessity, and composers began to experiment with various
combinations of instruments to secure a more adequate accompaniment for
the voice as well as to heighten the effects demanded by the drama.
<b>Monteverde</b>, an independent thinker and innovator, marked out
lines in which efforts should be made by successors. He studied the
<i>characteristic effects of</i> the various <i>groups</i> and made use of
them as he felt them. His orchestra for “Orfeo” (1608) was made up of two
harpsichords, ten tenor viols, two bass viols, two “little French
violins,” one double harp, two organs of wood, one regal, two viole de
gamba, two large guitars, two cornets, two trombones, three trumpets
with mutes, one octave flute, one clarion. The most significant item
is found in the “little French violins,” which presages the appearance
of the instrument which was, a century later, to be recognized as the
backbone of the orchestra. Among the distinctive instrumental effects
which Monteverde introduced was the <b>tremolo</b> for bowed string
instruments as well as the <b>pizzicato</b>. In looking over the
instruments of Monteverde’s orchestra we will note but <i>one</i> wood wind,
the flute. This shows that composers, doubtless through the military
use of brass and drums, had accepted the latter as means for special
effects. Instruments of the <i>wood wind</i> type were still too <i>crude</i> to
be admitted. <b>Alessandro Scarlatti</b>, who did so much for the opera
from the side of form and content, also contributed to the development
of orchestral music. He evidently perceived the importance of having a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
nucleus around which to build his harmonies, a group of instruments
which should furnish a firm support and which could blend the various
tone qualities. With the intuition of genius he selected the <b>string
tone</b> for this purpose, and in this he was greatly aided by the
fact that the Amati family, and their successors, Guarnerius and
Stradivarius, had already perfected the violin, although the great
players were yet to come. Scarlatti wrote in four parts for the
string instruments, the treble part to the first violin, the alto to
the second, the tenor part to the viola, which previously had often
played in unison with the double bass, while the bass part was taken
by ’cellos and basses. He also added <b>oboes</b> and <b>bassoons</b>
to the strings and brass. Lully in France used an orchestra similar to
that adopted by Scarlatti. The <b>kettle-drums</b> now come into use.
The works of Corelli and his violinist successors, which showed the
possibility of writing for strings, undoubtedly influenced orchestral writing.</p>
<p><b>Bach and Handel</b>.—We now come to the period of Bach and Handel,
each distinct in methods, the latter the more immediately influential
in the development of the orchestra, the former’s principles of writing
in the <b>polyphonic style</b> not being taken up until after years by
Wagner and more recently by the extreme modern composers with their
free polyphony. In a Bach score each instrument had an independent
part to sing, and was treated from a musical standpoint, whereas the
tendency of other composers was to seek figures and passages which
should be characteristic of the instrument, the standpoint of effect.
This particularly applies to the wind instruments. <b>Handel’s</b>
idea seemed to be the building up of great <b>mass effects</b>, his
style partook of the <b>harmonic</b> rather than the polyphonic. He
used all the important instruments found in the modern orchestra except
the <i>clarinet</i>, although the proportion of the wind instruments to
the strings is greater, due to the relatively inferior power of these
instruments in Handel’s time.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Haydn and Mozart</b>.—From Handel we pass to the first of his
three great successors, <b>Haydn</b>, who has been called the “father
of the symphony,” who determined, in fact, the course of orchestral
development. And we should not overlook the fact before-mentioned,
namely, that the professional violinists, most of whom were also
directors of orchestras in the pay of great princes, were testing
the capacities and resources of the instruments used. In the period
which Haydn represents, the <i>proportions of the instruments</i> in the
orchestra were definitely <i>fixed</i> and the size of the string band
became relatively greater, the <i>’cello</i> coming in to greater prominence
in its use as a <i>melody instrument</i>. Haydn’s last symphony, written in
1795, calls for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
kettle drums, and the usual string band. This was the combination which
Haydn selected as the most useful and effective, as the result of his
experience as a conductor for many years. It was to <b>Mozart</b> that
the introduction of the <b>clarinet</b> into the orchestra is due, for
Haydn did not employ this instrument in his earlier works. The clarinet
began to take an effective form about the end of the 17th century, yet
it was not until the 19th century that it received the improvements
that now make it one of the most useful instruments in the orchestra,
with a wonderfully facile technic and correct intonation. The greatest
of these changes was the application, to the clarinet, of the system
of keys and fingering invented by <b>Theobald Boehm</b> (1794-1881)
for the flute. In addition to showing the value of the clarinet as an
instrument, Mozart pointed the way to some uses of the <b>trombone</b>.
His E-flat Symphony is scored for one flute, two clarinets, two
bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, tympani and strings; in the score of
the “Jupiter” symphony, the clarinet does not appear.</p>
<p><b>Beethoven</b> established the orchestra as “the composer’s
instrument.” He added but little to the instruments used but he took
the resources established by his predecessors and demonstrated what
could be done with them. Every group of instruments was used with
more detail and to produce characteristic effects both separately and
in combination. In his first and second symphonies he uses the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
orchestra: two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
horns, two trumpets, tympani and strings; in the “Eroica,” a third
horn part is added; the fourth has the same orchestra as the first
two, except that one flute is dropped; the fifth calls for piccolo,
two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contra-bassoon,
two horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tympani and strings; in the
sixth he uses the same orchestra as in the fifth, except that he drops
the contra-bassoon and one trombone; in the seventh and eighth the
orchestra is the same as in his first and second symphonies. In the
ninth (Choral Symphony) he calls for a larger orchestra: piccolo, two
flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contra-bassoon, four
horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tympani, triangle, cymbals, bass
drum and strings. It will be noted that Beethoven does <i>not use the
harp</i>. It was not until 1820, seven years before Beethoven’s death,
that Erard invented the double-action harp, an effective and a playable instrument.</p>
<p><b>Berlioz, Wagner and Richard Strauss</b>.—The composer who first
made an exhaustive study of orchestral instruments, their distinctive
qualities, separately and in combinations, was <b>Berlioz</b>, who
gave to the world his knowledge in his “Treatise on Instrumentation,”
published in 1844. Berlioz gave to every one of his works a more or
less distinctive quality by varying the composition of his orchestra
instead of using the conventional combinations. He made frequent use
of the harp, bass clarinet, English horn, bass tuba, besides other
less frequently used instruments. He very much enlarged the scope of
orchestral music by the new effects he devised. <b>Richard Wagner</b>,
in his great music dramas, makes use of many new means of dramatic
musical effects, introducing new instruments, enlarging the various
families, dividing the strings into eight parts, increasing the number
of brass instruments, giving to his scores a richness of power and a
sonorous quality unknown before his time. <b>Richard Strauss</b> is,
today, the greatest master of the technic of orchestral writing. His
tone-poems make greater demands on the resources of the instruments and
contain effects beyond those of Wagner.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Hector Berlioz</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Hector Berlioz</b> (1803-1869) was the son of a French physician,
who designed him for his own profession. But the lad’s bent for music
was so strong that when sent to Paris to prepare for a medical degree,
he spent most of his time in going to the opera and in studying the
scores of the masters. Much against the will of his parents, he
determined to give up medicine and entered the <i>Conservatoire</i>. His
early musical training had been far from thorough and his career was
at first not successful. This added to his father’s displeasure, and
he finally withdrew all support from his son, who, rather than abandon
his art, struggled with the most crushing poverty until a violent
illness brought on by privation reconciled his parents to his choice of
a profession. After several unsuccessful attempts, he gained the great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Roman Prize, which entitled him to a period of study in Italy and
Germany at the cost of the State, but throughout his life he battled at
home with adverse and discouraging conditions, artistic and domestic.
Until after his death his works never received the recognition gladly
paid them in foreign countries, where he made frequent tours for
the purpose of producing them. His demand for exceptional means of
performance, based upon their large scope and previously unheard-of
effects, was ridiculed in France, where they were also considered
dissonant and bombastic; he encountered jealousy and intrigue at every
turn and bore them, too, in no patient spirit.</p>
<p><b>His Important Works</b>.—As a winner of the Roman Prize, however,
he had a claim on the State. Thus his great “Te Deum,” written for
three choruses, soli, and orchestra, was one of several commissions
from the Government and was composed for the opening of the Exposition
of 1855. Another similar colossal work is his “Requiem,” with its four
small orchestras of brass stationed at the corners of the principal
orchestra. These cross and re-cross with thrilling effect, simulating
the blowing of the last trump. His most popular and widely-known work,
“The Damnation of Faust,” a dramatic cantata now frequently heard in
this country and in Europe, failed to awaken the slightest interest
at its first performance in 1846 and involved the composer heavily in
debt. His enthusiasm for Shakespeare led to the composition of what
some consider his most important work, “Romeo and Juliet,” a symphony
for orchestra, solo voices and chorus. Berlioz’ genius was essentially
instrumental and symphonic in character; hence, though he composed a
number of operas, none was successful. Indeed, the failure of “Les
Troyens” (The Trojans), the subject of which was taken from the “Æneid”
and which he intended to be his masterpiece, was his death-blow.</p>
<p><b>His Genius as an Orchestral Composer</b>.—Berlioz was the founder
of the modern school of orchestration, as well as the pioneer in the
art of expressing a definite program in terms of absolute music. Like
his great contemporary, Wagner, he was no executant; he played but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
little and, curiously enough, only such insignificant instruments as
the flute, flageolet, and guitar. The orchestra was his instrument
and no one has ever had a more unerring instinct for its capabilities
either as a whole or in its component parts. In the origination of
weird, unearthly effects he had been anticipated by Weber, whom he
greatly admired; but he went beyond him in devising bold and daring
combinations, which he justified by the end in view, though it
cannot be said that a refined taste always finds this end in itself
justifiable. For example, in the last movement of his “Fantastic
Symphony,” he pictures an execution by the guillotine. A company
of witches and demons dance around the headless body and perform a
burlesque requiem—the whole supposed to be a nightmare suffered by
an artist under the influence of opium. Color rather than outline,
thrilling and novel effects of sonority, rhythmical variety and
animation, intensity of expression and dramatic climax are the
principal characteristics of Berlioz’ music. Yet delicacy and charm are
by no means lacking in his works. Irregular in proportion and unequal
in inspiration as they frequently are, they undoubtedly entitle him
to the distinction of being the greatest composer that France has yet produced.</p>
<p><b>The Music of the Orchestra</b> includes Symphonies, Overtures,
Symphonic Poems, Tone-Poems and Suites and the Concerto for a solo
instrument with orchestral support. The symphony is an elaborated
sonata, and the first movement is usually constructed on the principles
recognized under the term Sonata-form; the same principles are used in
the Overture, which consists of but a single movement. Liszt, in his
efforts in the program music style, devised the Symphonic Poem, which
aims to present a series of emotional pictures in the Symphonic style,
but with the various movements continuous. He advocated deriving <i>all</i>
themes from a <i>common source</i>, transforming them rhythmically as needed
to work out his conception. His successors in this style of music still
use the thematic methods devised by the writers in the true symphonic
style, but are free in their methods of construction and elaboration.

<h2>LESSON XXXVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Romantic Opera. Weber, Spohr, Marschner</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Romantic Movement</b>.—The revolutionary spirit which arose
in Europe toward the end of the 18th century had its counterpart in
a similar intellectual and artistic reaction, commonly known as the
Romantic Movement. In Literature, this movement was led by France; in
Music, by Germany. Briefly described, it consisted in casting aside
the classical traditions which the Renaissance had imposed upon art
in general and in a substitution of themes and a treatment more in
consonance with the atmosphere of freedom which had inspired such
momentous social and political changes.</p>
<p><b>Its Effect on Music</b>.—The musician also felt the influence of
the general unrest. In seeking new modes of expression, he rose to a
consciousness of independence both as man and artist; he refused longer
to occupy the position of an upper servant which had been decreed him
by court and nobility. Mozart marked the passing of the old order of
things by his indignant rejection of the humiliating conditions of
service under the haughty Archbishop of Salzburg, only remembered
by later generations through his connection with the musician he
treated so contemptuously. Heretofore music had been the privileged
entertainment of the great and wealthy. Like other privileges, it was
to pass into the possession of the people, hitherto shut out from its
enjoyment save in the Church. It was to draw inspiration from a rich
store of Folk-lore and poetry heretofore disregarded by the scholar
and the musician, but soon to be recognized as a national heritage of
high import; it was to create new forms instead of being dependent on
time-worn formulæ which were repressing growth and development.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>The Romantic Opera</b>.—The Romantic Movement had the
effect of finally banishing from the stage the characters of classical mythology,
the heroes and personages of antiquity who had been thought alone
worthy of representation by the poets and savants who had thus far
prepared the texts for operas. In the romantic opera their places were
taken by figures of legend or chivalry, elves and spirits of earth
or air; the action paid no regard to the unities of time and place;
it was brisk and animated and the supernatural played an important
part in it. The music, instead of being governed by the restraints of
definite forms, adapted itself to the varying exigencies of the drama;
the sharp division between the recitative and the aria was softened by
the introduction of the Scena, a peculiarly effective mingling of the
features of both; the overture became an integral part of the whole
by the use of themes associated with leading dramatic situations. The
orchestra not only supplied an harmonic and a rhythmically interesting
accompaniment but its power of independent expression was enormously
enlarged; it became, so to speak, one of the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>
and vied with the singers in indicating psychological and dramatic
crises. This was largely due to the development of a new phase of
instrumentation, perhaps the most striking detail of the Romantic
school—that of novel and original combinations of instruments to
produce varying and expressive shades of tone color. Heretofore
the orchestra had been considered in the main in its more obvious
divisions; sonority and beauty of tone had been the chief aim of the
classical composers. <b>Carl Maria von Weber</b> (1786-1826) was the
first to utilize the individual timbres of orchestral instruments to
secure effects of a weird, unearthly character.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
<b>Weber and the Romantic Opera</b>.—In his <i>Der Freischütz</i> (The
Freeshooter) we first find the union of all these characteristics.
Hence Weber is rightfully considered the founder of the romantic opera;
but it would be a mistake to assume that he was the originator of all
its features. These had been long in the air. In Haydn, the works of
Mozart and Beethoven, in the ballads of Loewe, the songs of Schubert,
unmistakable romantic traits can often be found, but they are embodied
in established forms. Weber, however, brought together the qualities
now associated with the term romantic in music, and in applying them to
the drama freed them from the restrictions of a fixed musical structure.</p>
<p><b>Influence of “Der Freischütz.”</b>—The effect of <i>Der Freischütz</i>
on its production in Berlin in 1821 was instantaneous. The story of the
hunter’s recourse to unholy arts in order to win success in the chase,
of his rescue from Satanic power and the final triumph of good over
evil; the music, fresh, vivid, essentially national in color, appealed
to the people to whom the legend was well known. It meant the birth
of German opera, German alike in drama and music; it gave the final
blow to the supremacy of foreign influences in Germany. This success
at first, however, was confined almost entirely to the people. Critics
and musicians generally could not reconcile themselves to its mingling
of styles; the supernatural element seemed to them exaggerated, the
introduction of the Folk-song wanting in dignity. Only the greatest
of them all, Beethoven, deaf and cynical as he was, realized the
signification of <i>Der Freischütz</i> as the beginning of a new era for
German art. He said to Rochlitz: “Weber should now write operas—one
after the other without hesitation.”</p>
<p><b>Euryanthe</b>.—Weber’s next opera was <i>Euryanthe</i>, produced
in 1823 in Vienna. In this he was hampered by a text of more than
doubtful merit and lacking the national element which had been so
strong a factor in <i>Der Freischütz</i>. The story is laid in the medieval
chivalric epoch and strongly resembles Shakespeare’s <i>Cymbeline</i>.
He also ventured upon an innovation which was not in favor with the
German public: he set it to music throughout, the place of the dialogue
customary in German opera being taken by accompanied recitative.
<i>Euryanthe</i> and Spohr’s <i>Jessonda</i>, which appeared several months
before the former, were the first German operas in this style since
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Schütz’s <i>Dafne</i>. This and its confused plot kept <i>Euryanthe</i> from the
popular success achieved by <i>Der Freischütz</i>, yet it contains some of
Weber’s most thrilling inspirations, and is the direct prototype of the
modern music drama.</p>
<p><b>Oberon</b>.—In <i>Oberon</i> (1826), composed for London to an English
text, Weber returned to his former manner, though somewhat against his
will. He found the English opera much the same as in Purcell’s time,
practically a play with music as an incidental feature rather than as
an integral part of the drama. He intended casting <i>Oberon</i> into a
larger mould, reducing the dialogue and adding to the music, but this
was prevented by his premature death in London two months after its production.</p>
<p><b>Recitative and Dialogue</b>.—The chilling effect of alternating
speech and song has already been spoken of in connection with the
English opera. At that time, both English and German taste was
against the use of recitative in the narrative parts of an opera.
The <i>recitativo secco</i>, which it will be remembered is a recitative
supported only by chords on the harpsichord or piano, sometimes
accompanied with a single stringed instrument, has never met with
favor outside of Italy, where its intonations nearly approach the
half-singing inflections of Italian speech. The exclusive use of
accompanied recitative—that is, the recitative accompanied by the
full orchestra, however, delays the action and moreover appears
weighty and overwrought unless applied to subjects of an elevated or
heroic character. In Germany and England the desire to understand
clearly the dramatic movement led to the retention of dialogue in
all operas. In France a distinction was made between operas with
dialogue and operas with recitative only. The first is called Opéra
Comique, originally an offshoot from the Italian <i>Opera Buffa</i>, in
which the <i>recitativo secco</i> was replaced by dialogue. Later the term
assumed a technical meaning by which it was applied to all operas
containing spoken dialogue whether their subjects were comic or tragic,
in contradistinction to what is known as Grand Opéra, in which the
accompanied recitative is used exclusively.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Melodrama</b>.—The so-called melodrama is a compromise between
the dialogue and the recitative. In this the performer recites in the
speaking voice while the orchestra supplies an accompaniment which
seeks to intensify the dramatic situation. This device originated in
Germany and has found the most favor from German composers. It was
first employed by <b>Georg Benda</b> (1721-1795) in a recitation,
<i>Ariadne in Naxos</i> (1744), which created much interest. Two of the
most striking instances of the melodrama are to be found in the
grave-digging scene in <i>Fidelio</i> and in the incantation scene in <i>Der
Freischütz</i>. But however effective its occasional use may be, the ear
suffers from the inevitable dissonance between the fixed pitches of the
musical scale and the natural inflections of the speaking voice. This
is now so generally recognized that it has been practically ignored by
modern composers in their works for the stage.</p>
<p><b>Spohr and the Romantic Opera</b>.—<b>Ludwig Spohr</b> (1784-1859),
Germany’s greatest violinist and a composer of eminence in many
fields, wrote a number of operas. Of these, <i>Faust</i> and <i>Jessonda</i>
stand first in showing a vein of genuine romanticism, albeit they
lack the Folk-element which brought Weber’s music so close to the
hearts of the people. Full of beauty as they undoubtedly are, like
all of Spohr’s music they are weakened by the constant recurrence of
certain mannerisms, such as chromatic progressions of a persistent
type, enharmonic modulations, the over-frequent use of diminished
intervals. Spohr exercised a strong influence in favor of the new
direction on account of his high position as the most esteemed composer
and performer of the day. His significance in the romantic movement
consists in his being, as it were, an intermediary between the late
classical period represented by Beethoven and the modern music drama.
He knew Beethoven in Vienna, and in his latter days, when director of
the opera in Cassel, did his utmost to introduce Wagner’s early operas
to the German public.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Marschner, Weber’s Successor</b>.—Weber’s legitimate successor
in the romantic opera was <b>Heinrich Marschner</b> (1795-1861). He
had been associated with Weber as assistant conductor at the opera
in Dresden, and a strong friendship existed between them. Weber’s
influence, however, was wide and far-reaching; it extended beyond
the opera. Marschner’s sphere was practically confined to the stage,
which he enriched with a series of strongly characterized works
mainly of a gloomy, uncanny nature. He shows but little of the genial
art with which Weber avails himself of the supernatural merely as a
background for the doing and striving of his characters, and thus never
compromises the human interest they have for us. Marschner makes it the
salient characteristic of his strongest works. In these his principal
<i>Dramatis Personæ</i> are demons and evil spirits who tempt and torment
the innocent and loving. His first romantic opera was <i>Der Vampyr</i>
(1825) composed to a text prepared from Byron’s poem, “Lord Ruthven,”
which is founded upon a Scotch legend. Notwithstanding the repulsive
nature of the subject, its powerful treatment brought it immediate
success in Germany and a little later in England. It was followed by
<i>Der Templar und die Jüdin</i> (The Templar and the Jewess), a version
of Scott’s “Ivanhoe.” This, however, met with less success than <i>Der
Vampyr</i> or its successor, <i>Hans Heiling</i>, Marschner’s masterpiece.</p>
<p><b>The Spieloper</b>.—The Romantic school had a strong influence
in the development of a form known as the <i>Spieloper</i> (literally
play-opera), which occupies a place between the works we have been
considering and the <i>Singspiel</i>. As thoroughly German as the latter,
it shows more finish and greater elaboration of musical effect. Though
essentially romantic in the freedom of its scope and choice of means,
its real sphere is neither the heroic nor the mystic; it concerns
itself rather with the lighter aspects of life, those which require no
exalted powers of imagination or wide culture to appreciate—humor,
good cheer, the merriment and mirth of the people in holiday mood.
<b>Albert Lortzing</b> (1803-1851) is accepted as the creator of this
type, of which his most popular opera, <i>Zar und Zimmermann</i> (Czar and
the Carpenter), is the best known example.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Influence of the Romantic Opera</b>.—The value of the application
of all the resources of music to the unfettered delineation of feeling
and emotion in all their phases inaugurated by the romantic opera
can hardly be over-estimated. From the opera it has won its way into
absolute music, creating new and original forms. The change it has
wrought in the progress and development of the art in general is only
second to the revolution occasioned by the birth of the opera itself,
three centuries ago. The impulse of the romantic movement in music
is far from being exhausted at the present day. On the contrary, it
seems to have gathered strength and if it has reached its culmination,
as some would have us believe, the signs are not yet apparent to an
unprejudiced observer.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXVIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The French School of the XIXth Century</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>French Schools of Opéra</b>.—As already explained, French opera
is divided into two styles, known as Opéra Comique and Grand Opéra,
according to the use of dialogue or recitative. Not that this is the
only difference. The Grand Opéra is naturally adapted to subjects of
a large or heroic scope; the Opéra Comique, like the <i>Spieloper</i> in
Germany, to lighter episodes of a romantic or humorous nature. As will
be seen, however, it not infrequently happens that the latter form is
adopted for serious subjects, owing to the fact that it is generally
easier for a composer to find acceptance at the Opéra Comique than
at the Grand Opéra. The youthful composer or the one who has not yet
acquired a name for himself is expected to win his spurs in the former
before attempting to enter the latter. Hence, even if his work is
somber or tragic in character he often finds it advisable to cast it
into the lighter form for the sake of having it produced.</p>
<p><b>The Opéra Comique</b>.—The Opéra Comique had its origin in the
introduction of the Opéra Buffa in Paris by an Italian company about
the middle of the 18th century, which led to the Gluck-Piccini
controversy. Pergolesi’s <i>La Serva Padrona</i> in particular awakened
great admiration and brought about the creation of a similar type
of French opera. It was at first hardly more than an elaboration of
the already existing vaudeville, or play with songs. <b>François
Philidor</b> (1726-1795) and <b>Andre Grétry</b> (1741-1813) were its
founders. Grace and simplicity, scrupulous adaptation of the music
to the clearness of diction always demanded by French taste were its
distinguishing characteristics.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Its Development</b>.—<b>Étienne Méhul</b> (1763-1817), a pupil of
Gluck, gave it a larger musical development and a greater depth of
dramatic feeling. His <i>Joseph</i> (1807), founded on Biblical history,
is a classic of this school. Its dignity, its severe and noble style
won less cordial recognition in France than in Germany; a generation
later it was to exercise a decisive influence on the future creator
of the music drama. It was through a performance of <i>Joseph</i> that
Richard Wagner, then director of the opera in Riga, first felt inspired
to battle against the empty conventionalities of the operatic stage.
Méhul’s enlargement of the Opéra Comique was carried on by Cherubini,
who through the ill-will of Napoleon found the doors of the Académie de
Musique, the technical title of the Grand Opéra, closed against him.
Even his greatest tragic opera, <i>Medée</i> (Medea), was produced (1797) as
an opéra comique without recitative and ballet, the latter being also
reserved exclusively for Grand Opéra. Thus it often happened that there
was little, in many cases no intrinsic difference between the music of
the two schools.</p>
<p><b>The Typical Opéra Comique</b>.—There was, on the other hand, a
development of a type more closely corresponding to the original scheme
of the Opéra Comique. Strongly influenced by the romantic tendencies
of the day, its romanticism by no means resembles that of the German
school as represented by Weber and his followers. This, in its appeal
to the deeper emotions by the idealization of nature and recourse
to the supernatural, is thoroughly alien to the Gallic temperament,
and had no appreciable effect on French composers. Gaiety and humor,
freshness of invention, lightness of touch, elegance and finish
characterize the true Opéra Comique. Its pathos never sinks below
a certain sentiment which is skilfully used rather for the sake of
contrast than from any persistent attempt at awakening the more somber
feelings. The singer and the actor both meet with consideration; the
former by sparkling melodies, expressive and grateful to sing, not
over-burdened with the technical difficulties in which the Italian
school abounds; the latter by a drama furnishing piquant situations,
seasoned with wit and interesting in itself as a play.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Boieldieu, its Founder</b>.—As Méhul gave the impulse to the
graver, more dignified style, so <b>François Boieldieu</b> (1775-1834)
laid the foundation of the typical Opéra Comique, the most original and
essentially national French operatic form. His <i>Jean de Paris</i> (John of
Paris) and <i>La Dame Blanche</i> (The White Lady) placed him at the head of
this school. The latter in particular, based on a curious combination
of situations taken from two of Scott’s novels, “The Monastery” and
“Guy Mannering,” has been sung the world over and still remains an
unsurpassed example of the Opéra Comique in its best estate.</p>
<p><b>Auber</b>.—The most prolific composer in this style was <b>Daniel
Auber</b> (1782-1871). Though he began as an amateur and after years
spent in other pursuits, he outlived all his early contemporaries
and became its most widely known representative. With one exception,
to be noticed later, his works reveal the salient characteristics
of the school—freshness and melodic charm, finesse of rhythm and
instrumentation, delicacy and refinement rather than power and depth.
His most popular opera, <i>Fra Diavolo</i> (1830), has been sung on all
stages and in almost all languages. Others less known but equally
meritorious are <i>Le Maçon</i> (The Mason and the Locksmith), <i>Le Domino
Noir</i> (The Black Domino) and <i>Les Diamants de la Couronne</i>
(The Crown Diamonds.)</p>
<p><b>Hérold and Adam</b>.—<b>Louis Hérold</b> (1791-1833), as a pupil
of Méhul, inclines to a more serious style. His <i>Zampa</i> contains
strongly romantic features which made it more successful in Germany
than the melodious <i>Le Pré aux Clercs</i> (The Clerks’ Meadow—a noted
duelling ground in Paris during the 17th century), though in France
this vies with <i>La Dame Blanche</i> in the distinction of being the most
popular Opéra Comique in the repertory. Though less significant than
any of the foregoing, <b>Adolphe Adam</b> (1803-1856), the composer of
<i>Le Postillon de Longjumeau</i> (The Postilion of Longjumeau), deserves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
mention for the grace and fluency of his melodies, albeit they show a
decline in character and style which prefigures the decadent school of
the <i>Opéra Bouffe</i> (burlesque opera).</p>
<p><b>Opéra Bouffe</b>.—The attentive observer can hardly fail to
perceive that the opera as appealing to the people at large more
than any other form of music is peculiarly susceptible to social and
political influences. The Opéra Bouffe being a degenerate offshoot
from the Opéra Comique, it is no mere accident that the period of its
most extended popularity coincided with the extravagance and folly
of the Second Empire. As a distinct type it is due to <b>Jacques
Offenbach</b> (1819-1880), a German by birth, who took advantage of
the taste of the time by turning his attention to the parody of the
classical and mythological subjects which had furnished material
for the early operas. Frivolous and mocking in text, sprightly and
vivacious in melody and rhythm, his operettas possess undoubted
piquancy and an effervescent style which for a time intoxicated the
public. Their vogue was happily broken by a series of light operas
of much more worth. Of these, <i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i>, known to
Americans as “The Chimes of Normandy,” by <b>Robert Planquette</b>
(1840-1903) is the best example.</p>
<p><b>The Influence of the Opéra Comique</b>.—The Opéra Comique, as
founded by Boieldieu and continued by Auber and Hérold, bears a
distinctively national character to a much greater degree than the more
cosmopolitan Grand Opéra. Unlike this, its development was entirely
due to native composers who gave it the thoroughly Gallic impress of
spirit, vivacity, and truth to nature which carried it triumphantly
through all the theatres of Europe. Thus it served to counteract in
part the reactionary tendency of Italian opera. In Paris, as elsewhere,
during the first quarter of the 19th century Italian influences
were very powerful; Rossini’s works and those of his imitators
had the undesirable effect of reviving in a modernized form the
conventionalized opera of the 18th century, the chief object of which
was the display of the singer. The Opéra Comique, though limited to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
lighter phases of the drama, performed a service of no small value in
upholding a standard of legitimate musical expression at a time when
the allurements of florid song were obscuring the dramatic ideals which
Gluck had established at the cost of so much labor and effort.</p>
<p><b>Grand Opéra</b>.—About the same time, important changes were
impending in Grand Opéra, though these were more in the nature of a
development from the type founded by Lully and afterward enlarged by
Rameau, Gluck and Spontini than a revolution such as Weber and his
followers had effected in Germany. They were, however, the outcome of
the same romantic influences modified by the characteristic French
adherence to established form. A grand opera according to tradition
must have five acts, consisting of arias, ensembles, choruses, etc.,
connected by recitatives, with a ballet in one or two of the middle
acts, generally the second and fourth.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Its Change of Style</b>.—Auber’s <i>La Muette de
Portici</i> (The Dumb Girl of Portici—known also as Masaniello), produced at
the Académie de Musique in 1828, formed the point of departure for the new
style. Though it held to the traditional form of Grand Opéra, it was in
spirit, theme and treatment a startling change from the ordinarily
genial works of this composer, characterized as it was by a force and
fire, a vigor and decision which he had never shown before and was
never to show again. It marks the beginning of the modern historical
opera, the complete abandonment of classical and ancient history as the
only appropriate material for Grand Opéra. The people were brought upon
the stage not as slaves or as meekly acquiescing in the will of those
in authority, but as insurrectionists demanding rights of which they
had been defrauded. The story of the Neapolitan fisherman leading his
comrades into rebellion against their tyrannical rulers had a powerful
effect in the agitated state of political affairs which culminated in
the revolutions of 1830. It is significant that a performance of <i>La
Muette de Portici</i> immediately preceded the riots in Brussels, which
in that year resulted in the expulsion of the Dutch from Belgium.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Rossini’s <i>William Tell</i>, which followed in 1829, manifested precisely
the same tendencies, musically as well as dramatically. Both were
destined to be cast into the shade by the works of a third composer
who gave the French grand opera a style which practically dictated
conditions on all stages for half a century and is still not without influence.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Giacomo Meyerbeer</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Meyerbeer</b>.—This composer was <b>Giacomo Meyerbeer</b>
(1791-1864), German by birth and early education, Italian by training
in more mature years, and finally French by adoption. A juvenile
pianist of great promise, he studied with Clementi; he went through a
severe course of fugue and counterpoint with Zelter, the teacher of
Mendelssohn; in composition he was a fellow-student with Weber under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the famous Abbé Vogler. In Vienna he knew Beethoven and was advised by
Salieri to study in Italy, where he wrote a number of Italian operas
after the style of Rossini. In 1826, he went to Paris, the Mecca of all
opera composers, with the design of making himself familiar with the
conditions of Grand Opéra.</p>
<p><b>His First Grand Opera</b>.—The result of his studies was <i>Robert le
Diable</i> (Robert the Devil) produced in 1831. This created a veritable
sensation. Nothing of so comprehensive a style had been seen or heard
before. Meyerbeer’s cosmopolitan education, his receptive rather than
original mind, enabled him to combine the outward characteristics at
least of the three schools—French, German, Italian—as no one had ever
attempted. The story of the arch-enemy of mankind seeking to ensnare a
son by an earthly mother into sharing his lost condition, the struggle
between the powers of good and evil for the mastery of the tempted
soul gave full scope to such an amalgamation of styles. The ballet
and spectacular effects of Lully, the supernaturalism of Weber, the
roulades of Rossini were all brought together with an art that dazzled
and intoxicated an admiring public.</p>
<p><b>His Other Grand Operas</b>.—Five years later <i>Robert</i> was followed
by <i>Les Huguenots</i> (The Huguenots), which achieved a still greater
success, and is the one opera of Meyerbeer which continues to hold
its own against the encroachments of time. In one or two episodes of
<i>Le Prophète</i> (The Prophet), which was produced in 1849, the composer
reached the highest level of his creative activity, notwithstanding the
manifest artificiality of his scheme. His last work, <i>L’Africaine</i> (The
African), was brought out the year after his death and like the others
owed its success to a skilful mingling of all the elements, musical,
spectacular, and dramatic, which go to make up this type of opera. His
<i>L’Étoile du Nord</i> (Star of the North) and <i>Le Pardon de Ploërmel</i>
(better known as Dinorah) were composed for the Opéra Comique.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Influence of Meyerbeer</b>.—Meyerbeer so held the public in his
grip that other composers of Grand Opéra gained but slight attention
during his lifetime. Only <b>Jacques Halévy</b> (1799-1862) was able
to meet him on equal terms in this field with <i>La Juive</i> (The Jewess),
in which he shows the earnest spirit of his master Cherubini. Though
Meyerbeer’s watchword was success at any cost and his aim to assure
it by the accumulation of cunningly devised sensations rather than
through the innate power of his music, his works had a powerful and,
on the whole, a beneficial influence on the course of modern dramatic
music. They placed living, palpitating beings on the stage instead of
the cold abstractions of mythology and antiquity; the singer was forced
to impersonate as well as to sing. His insistence on all means of
expression—vocal, instrumental, and scenic—though often exaggerated
and fatal to purity of style, led to an extension of technical ability
in all these directions, and prepared the way for a master of greater
power and higher aims. It must not be overlooked that Richard Wagner
frankly modeled his <i>Rienzi</i> (1842) after <i>Les Huguenots</i>, and that
Meyerbeer in <i>Le Prophète</i> shows plainly the influence of this work by
his German contemporary.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Italian School of the XIXth Century</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Later Italian School</b>.—While Meyerbeer was dominating the French
stage and through it exerting a powerful influence on serious opera
in all countries, the Italian school was recovering in part from the
impulse given it by Rossini. The highly ornamented style which he
brought into vogue was modified in the works of several composers who
also gave more consideration to truth of expression. With these, melody
still reigned supreme, but it was shorn of the excessive ornamentation
which overloaded Rossini’s music; in character and rhythm it was also
more generally in accord with sentiment and situation. The florid
element was by no means suppressed; it had been an integral factor in
Italian music for two centuries and was too strongly entrenched in
public favor to be banished so completely as it had been in the German
romantic opera, but it was kept in subordination and in the main not
allowed to dictate the melodic idea. This was a step in advance for
the Italian school of that period, which through the fluent warblings
of Rossini and his imitators, had approached dangerously near the
Scarlatti-Handel type of the previous century.</p>
<p><b>Donizetti</b>.—This reaction in the direction of greater simplicity
and sincerity was led by <b>Gaetano Donizetti</b> (1797-1848). At
first a follower of Rossini, he only attained success after the latter
had ceased composing and he himself had acquired a style of his own.
Donizetti was not without innate force, but his great melodic facility
led him to rely upon melody rather than upon musical development or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
dramatic characterization. Hence his tragic operas, though often
admirable in detail, lack the sustained strength demanded by
their subjects. Of these, <i>Lucia</i> (founded upon Scott’s “Bride of
Lammermoor”) achieved the greatest popularity, while in <i>La Favorita</i>
(composed for the Grand Opéra) he shows more dramatic power than in any
of his more than three-score operas. In many of his lighter works he
is particularly happy; for example, in <i>Don Pasquale</i>, which compares
favorably with Rossini’s <i>Il Barbiere</i>, and in <i>L’Elisire d’Amore</i>
(The Elixir of Love). <i>La Fille du Régiment</i> (The Daughter of the
Regiment—written for the Opéra Comique) has made the tour of the world.</p>
<p><b>Bellini</b>.—His younger contemporary, <b>Vincenzo Bellini</b>
(1801-1835), on the contrary, displays no capacity for humor nor is he
much better fitted to cope with the somber or the heroic. Essentially a
lyrical temperament, neither broad nor deep but endowed with exquisite
sensibility within certain limits, his sphere is the emotional, the
tender and the elegiac. For this reason his charming opera, <i>La
Sonnambula</i> (The Somnambulist), on account of its idyllic subject, is a
more representative work than <i>Norma</i> or <i>I Puritani</i> (The Puritans),
though both enjoyed high popularity until within recent years. Much of
Bellini’s vogue was due to the admirable singing of a number of Italian
artists who were identified with his works—Pasta, Grisi, sopranos;
Mario, tenor; Tamburini, baritone; Lablache, basso, not to forget
Jenny Lind, who was at her best in his operas. With their passing and
the establishment of the modern school of dramatic composition, in
which the voice is only one of many factors instead of being the chief
element of expression, they have gradually dropped from the repertory.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Verdi</b>.—A far more significant personality than either
Donizetti or Bellini is <b>Giuseppe Verdi</b> (1813-1901). Not merely a melodist
but a dramatist as well, his long life gave him the opportunity of
profiting by the many influences which brought about the mighty musical
development of the last hundred years. The fact that he did so without
compromising his artistic or national individuality shows the inherent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
genius which gives to him the distinction of being the great Italian
composer of the century. Strong and sturdy from the first, his early
works, if somewhat coarse in fiber, seemed doubly powerful in contrast
with those of his contemporaries, which were distinguished by sweetness
and melody rather than by depth or vigor. From <i>Ernani</i> to <i>Rigoletto</i>,
from the much sung <i>Trovatore</i> to <i>Don Carlos</i>, to mention only a few
of his thirty operas, Verdi shows a steady growth in largeness of
style and command of means which culminated in <i>Aïda</i>, written for the
Khedive of Egypt to celebrate the opening of the Suez canal in 1871.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="562" src="images/image363.jpg" width="450" id="img_images_image363.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Giuseppe Verdi</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Aïda</b>.—<i>Aïda</i> is the full fruition of the Romantic movement
beyond the Alps, manifested, however, in a style and manner thoroughly
Italian. Unmistakably influenced by the uncompromising stand taken in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Germany by Wagner, Verdi here shows the definite adoption of a new
standard, yet by methods which make no decided break with what he
had hitherto accomplished. In form, <i>Aïda</i> is closely allied to the
Meyerbeer type of Grand Opéra through its succession of dramatic and
spectacular features, but these develop naturally in the course of the
action and are combined with a sincerity and unity of effect lacking in
the more artificial creations of the German composer. The florid style
is strictly avoided; without the continuous flow of the music drama,
the different movements, recitatives, arias, ensembles, etc., are yet
more closely connected and are sustained by a richer, more fluent
orchestration than he had hitherto given to his operas, the local color
called for by the Egyptian theme receiving adequate consideration.</p>
<p><b>Significance of Aïda</b>.—<i>Aïda</i> marks the beginning of the new
Italian school, one more in sympathy with the original conception of
the opera as a drama, while retaining the characteristic Italian grace
and charm of vocal treatment. This school was still further enlarged
and developed by Verdi, but this extension belongs to a later period
and will be considered in its logical connection.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Wagner and the Music Drama</b>.—It is to <b>Richard Wagner</b>
(1813-1883) that we owe the renaissance in modern form of the primitive
ideal of the opera as embodied in the works of Peri and Caccini. Simple
and formless as these now appear, they contain the germ of all that he
has accomplished, apart from the question of means, even to the very
name of music drama. This he revived because, in his opinion, the term
opera had acquired a preponderantly musical signification which made it
inappropriate for his later works in view of their dramatic character.
An exception to the general rule of precocity among musicians, it was
not until his sixteenth year that he resolved to devote himself to
music. Like Weber, whom as a child he saw frequently and regarded with
the utmost reverence, his early associations were with the theatre and
the drama, a fact of no small significance in the careers of both. <i>Der
Freischütz</i> was his favorite opera, a liking which bore abundant fruit in later years.

<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Wagner in 1853</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>His Early Operas</b>.—The future master of the music drama,
however, began by composing operas—operas, moreover, in which he shows
originality in one feature only—that of writing their texts himself,
and this remained his invariable practice. In other respects they gave
no hint of the startling individuality he was to unfold so unexpectedly
in his <i>Flying Dutchman</i>. His first opera was <i>Die Feen</i> (The Fairies).
It was based on a fairy tale of but slight worth, and the music was
strongly reminiscent of Weber and Marschner. As the work of a youth
of twenty, without reputation or influence, it is hardly surprising
that he found no manager willing to produce it. He was somewhat more
fortunate with his second opera, <i>Das Liebesverbot</i> (The Love Veto), an
adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure.” This was performed
once, in 1836, at Magdeburg, where he was director of the opera, and
had thus come under the influence of the French and Italian composers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
then popular in Germany. The music is such a palpable imitation of
Adam, Auber, Donizetti, and Bellini that it has never been given since.
<i>Die Feen</i> was never produced during his lifetime, but a few years
after his death received a number of representations in Munich.</p>
<p><b>His Sojourn in Paris</b>.—In 1839, he determined to go to Paris.
Many foreign composers had succeeded in entering the Grand Opéra, among
them Meyerbeer, then in the full flush of the renown he had gained
with <i>Les Huguenots</i>. What one German had done, another might attempt.
Accordingly, with the utmost faith in his star and amid manifold
discouragements, Wagner made his way to the French capital, where he
hoped through the influence of Meyerbeer to secure the acceptance of
his <i>Rienzi</i> at the Grand Opéra. He had prepared it from Bulwer’s
novel of the same name with the express intention of utilizing it as a
framework for the large spectacular style demanded by the Académie de
Musique. His sojourn in Paris brought him nothing but disappointment.
Neither <i>Rienzi</i> nor <i>Der Fliegende Holländer</i> (The Flying Dutchman),
which he wrote during his stay of two and a half years, was successful
in winning a hearing, while he lived the greater part of the time in
the most painfully straitened circumstances.</p>
<p><b>Rienzi</b>.—Before long, he realized the hopelessness of his
endeavor and sent <i>Rienzi</i> to Dresden, where it was accepted and after
a long delay performed in 1842. The result was a triumphant success and
led to the speedy production of <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>. This, however,
by no means made a similar impression. <i>Rienzi</i> was an opera of the
type made familiar by Meyerbeer, in which effect was secured by the
heaping together of every device known to stagecraft. The ballet, the
march of the Messengers of Peace, the final catastrophe of the burning
of Rome, had as much to do with its enthusiastic reception as the
music, which was noisy, showy and brilliant, as befitted a work of such calibre.</p>
<p><b>The Flying Dutchman. Change of Style</b>.—<i>The Flying Dutchman</i>,
however, showed Wagner in an entirely different light. With it, instead
of receiving his inspiration from without, as had been the case with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the preceding operas, it came from within. On his way to Paris he
had made a stormy voyage of several weeks from a port on the Baltic
to London. He was familiar with the myth of the Flying Dutchman, and
found that the sailors on board his ship believed it implicitly. This
in connection with Heine’s version of the legend, which represents the
unhappy mariner as doomed to perpetual wandering on stormy seas until
he finds a woman faithful unto death, made a strong impression on him,
and while in Paris he wrote the poem and composed the music within
seven weeks after finishing <i>Rienzi</i>. A more sudden metamorphosis of
style is unknown in the history of music. The earlier work was an opera
pure and simple, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, characterized
by pomp, brilliancy, sonority. Its successor was conceived as a
drama in which music served to emphasize the action and to intensify
the emotional situations; instead of being master, it was servant;
external effects were disregarded save only as they were in harmony
with this conception. Not that the composer entirely achieved this
ideal; <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> displays not a few lapses into operatic
conventionalities, but as a whole it was a startling and radical change
which puzzled and displeased the public. They had looked for something
in the style of <i>Rienzi</i> and could make nothing of a work so contrary
to the popular idea of what an opera should be. Accordingly, after a
few performances, it was dropped from the repertory.</p>
<p><b>Tannhäuser</b>.—Nothing daunted by the lack of favor shown his
change of style, Wagner carried it to a still greater extent in his
next opera, <i>Tannhäuser</i> (1845), founded on a medieval legend. The
dramatic motive of this is much the same as that of <i>The Flying
Dutchman</i>, one of which Wagner was particularly fond—the power of love
to redeem and save from the consequences of sin and error. <i>Tannhäuser</i>
brought about his head the full storm of hostile criticism which with
<i>The Flying Dutchman</i> had only begun to lower. He was reproached for
its difficulty, for its lack of pleasing melodies, for the audacious
harmonies which many critics considered inexcusable dissonances.
Singers objected to the broad declamation it required; they complained
that it would eventually ruin their voices.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Lohengrin</b>.—This almost general dissatisfaction, however, led
to no concessions by the composer in his next opera, <i>Lohengrin</i>,
which marked a further advance in the unpopular direction taken by its
predecessors, but it interfered with its performance. Though he was
conductor of the Opéra at Dresden, he could not secure permission to
produce it. Baffled and discouraged in his artistic schemes, a radical
in politics, he joined the insurrectionists during the revolution of
1849. The failure of the rebellion necessitated a hasty flight from
Germany. He took refuge in Switzerland and remained in exile until a
proclamation of amnesty in 1861 allowed him to return. In the meantime
he had sent the score of <i>Lohengrin</i> to Liszt, then conductor of the
opera at Weimar, and there it was brought out in 1850.</p>
<p><i>Lohengrin</i> proved the turning-point in his fortunes. The romance of
the subject, its dramatic treatment and undeniable beauty gradually
reconciled the public to the novelty of its style. Before Wagner was
relieved from his sentence of banishment it had become one of the most
popular operas in Germany—he once ruefully remarked that he would soon
be the only German who had not heard it.</p>

<h2>LESSON XL.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Richard Wagner’s Music Dramas.<br>Other Schools</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Wagner’s Theory of the Music Drama</b>.—<i>Lohengrin</i>, like <i>The
Flying Dutchman</i>, was transitional in character and led into Wagner’s
third manner. It was his last opera; all his later works were known
as music dramas. In these he pursued unhesitatingly the logical
conclusions of the theories which he expounded at great length in his
controversial writings, though he was far from being always consistent
with himself. Thus he reasoned that since in the spoken drama but one
speaker is heard at a time, the same practice should prevail in the
music drama, which would naturally do away with all concerted music,
choruses, etc. This rule he observed in <i>The Ring of the Nibelungen</i>,
but he wisely abandoned it in his later works. In <i>Die Meistersinger</i>
he also failed to follow his theory that mythical and legendary
subjects were the only suitable material for the music drama. Briefly
stated, his ultimate conclusion was as follows: that the art-work of
the future, as he called it, should consist of a synthesis of all the
arts. Music, poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, he asserted,
had exhausted all that was possible to them as separate arts; a higher
plane could be reached hereafter only by a combination which should
gain unity by subordination to a single principle. This principle he
found in poetry. Beethoven, he argued, had felt the insufficiency of
music alone to express his deepest inspiration, and for that reason had
incorporated in his last and greatest symphony a choral movement to the
words of Schiller’s “Ode to Joy.” In the music drama, therefore, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
scene painter replaces the artist and the architect, the actor by
plastic poses the sculptor, while the musician must allow his music
no form but that dictated by the poet in his verses. He ascribed the
thrilling effect of the Greek drama to such a union of the arts and
this it was his aim to revive through his own works.</p>
<p><b>The Leading Motive</b>.—The part assigned by the Greek dramatists
to the chorus who expounded and commented on the events of the play
was in his scheme transferred to the orchestra. This he did by means
of the <i>Leitmotiv</i> (leading motive). A leitmotiv is a characteristic
theme or harmonic progression associated with each of the <i>Dramatis
Personæ</i> and which appears with such modification of mode, rhythm, or
any of its component parts as the dramatic situation demands. It is
not confined to personages alone; in <i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i>, for
instance, the stolen gold, the ring formed from it, the sword which
plays such an important part in <i>Die Walküre</i> and in <i>Siegfried</i> all
have their corresponding motives. It is through these motives that
Wagner is able to give his orchestra an all but articulate speech and
to weld the music drama into an organic whole. By their transformation
and development he succeeds in indicating psychological states and
changes as well as material conditions and objects. Reminiscent themes
of a somewhat similar nature had been used as far back as Mozart and
had been employed more freely by composers of the Romantic school,
notably by Weber in <i>Der Freischütz</i> and <i>Euryanthe</i>, but they were
undeveloped and elementary in character. Berlioz in his <i>Fantastic
Symphony</i> was the first to conceive a typical theme and to alter it in
logical accordance with the progression of his program, but he did not
adopt the practice in his operas.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Unending Melody</b>.—Beginning with <i>Lohengrin</i>, Wagner
abandoned fixed forms and substituted what he called unending melody,
a practically continuous flow of tone divided alike between voices and
instruments. For the most part he assigned the singer a declamation
as far removed from the set aria on the one hand as it was from dry
recitative of the early Italian opera on the other. Yet like the latter
it was conditioned by principles of speech. Like the early composers,
also, his subjects with but two exceptions were mythical or legendary.
This, because the supernatural and the unreal correspond more closely
with the ideal element introduced by the use of song for speech than
material drawn from everyday experience or from the exact chronicles of
history.</p>
<p><b>The Ring of the Nibelung</b>.—In the old Teutonic folk-epic, the
<i>Nibelungen Lied</i> (Lay of the Nibelung), Wagner found the inspiration
for his next and most extended work. This is the great tetralogy, <i>Der
Ring des Nibelung</i> (The Ring of the Nibelung), composed of four dramas
designed for continuous representation: <i>Das Rheingold</i> (The Rhine
Gold), <i>Die Walküre</i> (The Valkyrie), <i>Siegfried</i>, <i>Die Götterdämmerung</i>
(The Twilight of the Gods). It was begun and partially finished during
his stay in Switzerland, but his discouragement over what he felt to be
the hopeless task of ever securing its performance led him to abandon
it and to set to work on another drama which he decided should be
lighter in character and less difficult to execute, in order the more
readily to find acceptance.</p>
<p><b>Tristan and Isolde</b>.—The result of this resolution was <i>Tristan
und Isolde</i>, but far from being a return to his earlier style, as he
had planned, it was and probably still is the most intricate operatic
score in existence. It was accepted by the Opera in Vienna, but after
fifty-seven rehearsals the singers declared themselves unable to
learn it and it was given up as impossible of execution. Three years
after his return to Germany an unlooked-for change took place in his
fortunes. The young king of Bavaria, Ludwig II, who had just ascended
the throne, had been an ardent admirer of Wagner since as a boy of
fifteen he had heard <i>Lohengrin</i>. Hardly had he taken his seat before
he summoned the discouraged composer to Munich and assured him support
and protection. <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> was soon brought out (1865), and
Wagner busied himself with the composition of <i>Die Meistersinger von
Nürnberg</i> (The Master Singers of Nuremberg), produced in 1868.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Die Meistersinger</b>.—This is his only comic work, full of
hitherto unsuspected humor and geniality. The story of the young poet
endeavoring to gain admission to the jealously-guarded ranks of the
master singers who, notwithstanding the beauty of his song, reject
him because he has violated their hide-bound rules has a distinctly
autobiographic value. Wagner had endured too much from similar pedants
to be lenient with the picture he drew of their prototypes in medieval
Nuremberg. As strikingly diatonic in style as <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>
is chromatic, these two works are the strongest illustrations of his
versatility.</p>
<p><b>Bayreuth and the Festival Theatre</b>.—Wagner had long cherished
the plan of a festival theatre for the performance of his <i>Ring of
the Nibelung</i>. Jealousy of his favor with the king led to various
intrigues which prevented the building of such a theatre in Munich.
The quiet town of Bayreuth, therefore, as being a central point, was
chosen, and there in 1876 the <i>Festspielhaus</i> was opened with the first
complete performance of the Tetralogy. It made a profound impression,
but the expense of the undertaking was so great that it resulted in a
heavy loss and the theatre was closed for a number of years. In 1882,
however, it reopened with <i>Parsifal</i> and since then its triumphant
career has been part of musical history.</p>
<p><b>Parsifal</b>.—Until 1903, when it was given in this country,
<i>Parsifal</i> was heard only in Bayreuth. Its semi-sacred character,
its mingling of religious mysticism and sorcery, its unrivaled stage
effects, its overwhelming power of climax, the consummate art of its
thematic construction have made it the most discussed of Wagner’s
works. What place it may eventually hold in respect to the others can
be decided only by time. As it is, it stands alone; a second <i>Parsifal</i>
is hardly conceivable.</p>
<p><b>Influence of Wagner</b>.—Unlike Weber, Wagner did not create a
school—he belonged to the school which Weber founded. Like Gluck, his
influence permeated all schools but to a much greater extent; none has
succeeded in escaping it. Thus far in Germany it has been felt more in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the development of program music, the symphonic poem, etc., than in the
music drama itself. Many have attempted to follow directly in his
steps, among them <b>August Bungert</b> (1846———) with a cycle of
music dramas, <i>Die Homerische Welt</i> (The World of Homer), founded
upon the Iliad and the Odyssey, and <b>Richard Strauss</b> (1864———)
with his <i>Guntram</i>, <i>Feuersnoth</i> (Fire Famine) and <i>Salome</i>, but none
has yet shown the power to bend the bow of Achilles. <b>Engelbert
Humperdinck</b> (1854———) is the only one of Wagner’s successors to
develop a new phase of the music drama. This he did by applying it to
the fairy tale in his <i>Hänsel und Gretel</i> (1893), which soon found its
way to all stages, the first German opera to have such a success since
the death of Wagner.</p>
<p><b>Wagner in France</b>.—In France, Wagner acted at first not so much
directly as indirectly, and more in his connection with the Romantic
school of Weber than through his individual style as revealed in the
music drama. The characteristic conservatism of the French school
was shown in holding to forms which had been fixed for generations,
but little by little these were filled with the new romantic spirit.
This comes to the fore in <b>Charles Gounod</b> (1818-1893), whose
<i>Faust</i> (1859) has exercised a strong and lasting influence on the
lyric drama in France. Though set forms are not abandoned, they
are closely joined by a melodious declamation which approaches the
song-speech of Wagner; the orchestration, too, is unmistakably romantic
in treatment. <b>Georges Bizet</b> (1838-1875) in <i>Carmen</i> (1875), an
opéra comique notwithstanding its tragic denouement, produced a work
of great individuality, which shows even more plainly the influence
of modern romanticism. Had the composer’s career not been cut short
by his untimely death, it is possible that the French school would
have maintained a more commanding position. For Paris no longer holds
her former preëminence as operatic centre; she has been distanced by
Bayreuth. Of late years the works that have had the most pronounced
success in the French capital have been Wagner’s music dramas. A little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
more than a generation ago, in the palmy days of Auber and Meyerbeer,
a success at the Grand Opéra or the Opéra Comique had an international
import and meant a speedy transference to foreign stages. Now the
interest is largely local; but few of the modern French operas are
heard outside of France. The influence of Wagner is evident in a new
French school, consisting in the main of young composers whose works
manifest strongly transitional features. At present this school is
in its storm and stress period; it is yet too early to forecast its
ultimate effect.</p>
<p><b>Wagner in Italy</b>.—Italy proved more responsive to Wagner’s
influence than France. The performance of <i>Lohengrin</i> (1868), in
Bologna, created much enthusiasm among the young musicians of northern
Italy, but it was the septuagenarian Verdi who inaugurated the era of
the music drama by his <i>Otello</i> (1887) and <i>Falstaff</i> (1893). Strictly
speaking, he had been anticipated by <b>Arrigo Boïto</b> (1842———),
who, thrown under Wagner’s influence in Germany, had followed his
example in being the poet and composer alike of <i>Mefistofele</i> (1868),
a version of the Faust legend. But this was Boïto’s only opera, and
though he gave the initial impulse to the movement, it was Verdi who
carried it to a triumphant issue.</p>
<p><b>Verdi’s Latest Style</b>.—<i>Aïda</i> had been a grand opera with strong
musico-dramatic tendencies. In <i>Otello</i> and <i>Falstaff</i>, Verdi made
a definite entrance into the music drama. The latter in particular,
founded on Shakespeare’s “Merry Wives of Windsor,” is an astonishing
<i>tour de force</i> for a man of four-score years. Full of the sparkle
and freshness of youth, yet in every measure revealing the ripeness
of matured genius, it is one of an immortal trio of lyric comedies of
which the others are Mozart’s <i>Figaro</i> and Wagner’s <i>Meistersinger</i>.
The set and traditional forms of the opera here disappear entirely; the
music is conditioned by the text and its dramatic requirements; the
orchestra supports the voices in a full, melodious, and comprehensive
flow, but never overpowers them. Hardly anything can be detached from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
its context without losing significance and interest; and this, by the
way, is one of the most distinctive peculiarities of the music drama
and more than anything else points the radical difference between it
and the opera. Yet though this change of manner is undoubtedly due to
Wagner, Verdi is in no sense an imitator. The style remains his own and
is essentially Italian in character—that is, it is based upon vocal
rather than instrumental capabilities.</p>
<p><b>The New Italian School</b>.—The latest development of the music
drama in Italy has been in the direction of so-called naturalism. This
consists in the choice of brutal phases of life for illustration, told
in short, concise forms which concentrate and hasten the dramatic
action. A greater contrast to the inordinately long and heroic operas
of Meyerbeer and Wagner can hardly be imagined; it is more than
probable, indeed, that the reaction against the excessive length of
the music drama led to the great and sudden vogue of this school.
The first impulse to naturalism was given by <b>Pietro Mascagni</b>
(1863———) in his two-act opera, <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> (Rustic
Chivalry), in 1890. This is a tale of love, jealousy, and revenge
told in music admirably adapted to the vivid, crude representation
of elemental passions. Two years later followed <i>I Pagliacci</i> (The
Clowns) by <b>Ruggiero Leoncavallo</b> (1858———), a work of precisely
the same character. Though many others have essayed the same style,
these two thus far remain the most representative of their class. Their
popularity has been approached only by <b>Giacomo Puccini</b> (1858———)
in <i>La Bohême</i> (The Bohemians), produced in 1896. Four years later his
<i>Tosca</i> appeared and did much to strengthen the impression given by
its predecessor—that in Puccini Italy possesses her most promising
dramatic composer.</p>
<p><b>Schools Compared</b>.—Thus at the beginning of the 20th century
we find the principles of the music drama as enunciated by Wagner
influencing all the three great schools of dramatic composition. It is
worthy of note, however, that these schools, though thus approaching in
artistic ideals, still retain the characteristics which distinguished
them from the very beginning: the Italian, melody and beauty of tone;
the French, clearness of form and logical dramatic development; the
German, elevation of subject and harmonic richness.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Younger Schools</b>.—Younger schools having a strongly national
character exist in Russia and Bohemia, but as yet they possess only
local signification and have produced no practical effect outside of
their respective countries. <b>Michael Glinka</b> (1803-1857) with his
patriotic opera, <i>Life for the Czar</i>, founded the Russian opera in
1836. The Bohemian opera is of more recent origin and is associated
principally with the names of <b>Friedrich Smetana</b> (1824-1884) and
<b>Antonin Dvořák</b> (1841-1904).</p>
<p><b>Resumé</b>.—From its dual nature, the opera is necessarily a
compromise. Composed of two elements, the musical and the dramatic, it
is peculiarly susceptible to disintegration; its history is a record of
almost continuous veering from one to the other of these two phases.
We have seen how the immense proportions of the ancient amphitheatres
led to the musical declamation on which the opera is founded, from
the fact that the tones of the singing voice are far more reaching
than those of the voice in speaking. The Florentine experimenters, in
seeking to restore this declamation, soon discovered the capabilities
for emotional expression latent in the varying timbres and vastly
extended range of the former. As for its musical possibilities, these
were entirely beyond their ken. The steps taken in that direction they
regarded with disfavor as indicating a deviation from the oratorical
standards which were their sole aim. After Carissimi and Scarlatti had
developed the elements of symmetrical form and melody, music emerged
from this dependent condition and dictated to the drama, which sank
to an almost negligible factor. The reaction led by Gluck served to
restore the balance for a time, but through Rossini and his followers
the pendulum again swung in the other direction. The Romantic movement
then brought the drama again to the fore; the spirit of the age was
behind it and all schools felt its influence, though each manifested it
in characteristic fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Influence of the Opera on Music in General</b>.—These alternations
have had a powerful effect on the development of music in general, an
effect both technical and expressive in nature. From the harpsichord
and the few viols used at first merely to support the voice and to
give it pitch, the orchestra expanded into a large body of instruments
capable in itself of dramatic utterance. From the tiny ritornello of
eight measures played by three flutes in Peri’s <i>Euridice</i>, there has
grown an independent instrumental art of vast significance. The opera
also created a school of singing which though often unworthily used
for purposes of purely personal display is the basis of the vocal art
of today. In short, it is not too much to say that the little band of
scholars and musicians who met three centuries ago with the aim of
reviving a lost art practically originated a new one.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Piano Playing and Composition: Clementi to Field</span></span>.</h2>
<p>During the period after Mozart to the beginning of the Romantic
movement, one name alone attains the first rank—that of Beethoven.
At the same time there are several epoch-making pianists, whose
compositions display talent rather than genius, but who have each
rendered indisputable service in accomplishing the transition from the
classic to the romantic composers. The landmarks, so to speak, of this
period are Clementi, Cramer, Hummel, Czerny, Moscheles and Field.</p>
<p><b>Muzio Clementi</b> (1752-1832) was born at Rome. His father was
quick to perceive his son’s gift for music, and strove to develop it by
the best teaching available. While he was still a lad, an Englishman,
Bedford or Beckford, took young Clementi with him to England where
he lived with his benefactor until 1770, perfecting himself in piano
playing and composition. At his first appearances in London he created
a furore, and from 1777-1780 he conducted at the piano in the Italian
opera there. In 1781, he began his travels as a virtuoso. At Vienna he
made the acquaintance of Josef Haydn, and also had a sort of musical
combat with Mozart. Each read at sight, played his own compositions and
improvised. Opinion was divided as to the outcome. Clementi displayed
more virtuosity, while Mozart charmed by his singing-tone, finished
phrasing and expressive style. For the following twenty years, Clementi
lived in London. He became interested in a piano manufactory and when
the firm failed, he established another, which is still carried on. In
1802, Clementi went on a concert-tour with two favorite pupils, J. B.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Cramer and John Field. They visited Paris, Vienna and even St.
Petersburg, arousing great enthusiasm everywhere. In 1810, he settled
in London permanently, devoting himself to composition and business. In
1817, he published his <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>, a series of one hundred
studies treating every branch of technic and every problem of piano
playing then known.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="497" src="images/image381.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image381.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Muzio Clementi</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Clementi as Composer and Pianist</b>.—In addition to his early
works, Clementi composed symphonies, more than one hundred sonatas for
piano, preludes, toccatas, canons and other piano music and finally the
<i>Gradus</i>. As Clementi was a true Italian by temperament, and German in
his education, the sonatas show the influence of Domenico Scarlatti, as
well as of Haydn and Mozart. They are technically in advance of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
day, though inclined to dryness musically. However, Beethoven admired
them, and is said to have preferred them to those of Mozart. Clementi’s
monumental work, the studies, treats every difficulty and style of
piano playing so very comprehensively that it is still indispensable
to the student. In his youth Clementi was a bravura-player, pure and
simple. “Strong in runs of thirds, but without a pennyworth of feeling”
was Mozart’s verdict. But later, when Clementi had become acquainted
with the larger tone of the English pianos, he cultivated expressive
playing. At his best, his brilliancy and facility were dazzling, and he
invariably carried all before him. Considering the fundamental value of
his studies, and his preëminent abilities as a pianist, it is just to
give him the title of “The Father of Piano Playing.”</p>
<p><b>Johann Baptist Cramer</b> (1771-1858) was born at Mannheim, Germany.
When he was but a year old his father moved to London. As a boy he
studied the violin and the piano, as well as the theory of music, but
soon showed the greater aptitude for the piano. Later he became a pupil
of Clementi. Handel, Bach, Scarlatti, Haydn and Mozart were the objects
of his attention, thus establishing a taste for the classics. In 1788,
Cramer began a series of tours on the Continent, living at London in
the intervals. In 1828, he founded the music publishing firm of J.
B. Cramer &amp; Co. He lived in Paris from 1832 to 1845, but returned to
London, where he remained until his death.</p>
<p><b>Cramer as Composer and Pianist</b>.—Of Cramer’s numerous
compositions, such as seven concertos and one hundred and five sonatas
for the piano, besides variations, rondos, fantasias, etc., a quartet
and quintet, little is worth survival. His representative work is a
series of seventy-six studies, Op. 50, to which he afterwards added.
These studies long enjoyed a reputation second only to those of
Clementi. They do not aim primarily at virtuosity, but towards the
cultivation of musical style; at the same time they exhibit novelty of
technical invention, and demand a decided proficiency. Thus they tend
to supplement the studies of Clementi which are chiefly concerned with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
technic. As a performer, Cramer was greatly admired for his perfect
legato, distinctness of phrasing and quiet singing tone. Beethoven
is said to have preferred him to all other pianists of his time.
While Cramer does not present a technical advance over Clementi, he
undoubtedly did much for the cultivation of the more strictly musical
qualities and thus stands for a definite progress.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="285" src="images/image383.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_image383.jpg">
<p class="f120_bold space-below2"><span class="smcap">J. B. Cramer.     J. N. Hummel</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Johann Nepomuk Hummel</b> (1778-1837) was born at Presburg, Hungary.
His father, who had been instructor in music at a military school in
Wartburg, moved to Vienna in 1786 to become director at the theatre of
Schikaneder, (the author of the libretto of Mozart’s opera “The Magic
Flute”). Mozart soon took so deep an interest in young Hummel that he
took him to live with him and taught him for two years. From 1788 to
1795, Hummel traveled as a virtuoso. On returning to Vienna he studied
composition with Albrechtsberger, and received advice from Salieri and
Haydn. From 1804 to 1811 he was music-director under Prince Esterhazy,
Haydn’s patron. In 1816, he became conductor at Stuttgart, and in 1819
he occupied a similar position at Weimar. From here he went to Russia,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
where he made a successful concert-tour, playing at Warsaw, where
the youthful Chopin heard him. From 1825 to 1833 he traveled on
concert-tours, returning to Weimar, where he passed the remainder of his life.</p>
<p><b>Hummel as Composer and Pianist</b>.—Hummel’s compositions include
operas, ballets, masses and other church music, a quintet, trios,
rondos, studies and other music for the piano, but he is best known
for the piano concertos in A-flat, A minor and B minor, the sonatas
in F-sharp minor and D major, the Septet, Op. 74, and a voluminous
instruction-book for the piano, chiefly remarkable for its pedantry
and absence of practicality. As a pupil of Mozart, he followed his
teacher’s form and style, without exhibiting marked creative genius.
His technic is noticeable chiefly for its superficial glitter of
brilliant passages, which constitute a certain development in
themselves. His compositions were in great vogue at one time, and he
was once even regarded as the equal of Beethoven. As a pianist, Hummel
was unusual. His style was distinguished by precision, clearness, and
command of brilliant effect. His influence as a concert pianist was
very great, and in this direction his extension of the province of the
virtuoso is considerable. He undoubtedly affected Chopin’s piano style
for a time and for this reason alone should claim our attention.</p>
<p><b>Carl Czerny</b> (1791-1857) was born at Vienna. His father, an
excellent musician, taught his son piano playing at an early age.
Beethoven became interested in him, and gave him lessons. He also
learned much from Hummel and Clementi. Czerny soon became in great
demand as a teacher. He made concert-tours to Leipzig, Paris, London
and Lombardy. For the most part he lived quietly in Vienna, teaching
and composing. In 1850, his health gave way from overwork. His most
celebrated pupils were Franz Liszt and Theodore Leschetizky.</p>
<p><b>Czerny’s Compositions</b>.—Czerny was an indefatigable and
over-fluent composer who weakened his powers by over-productivity.
Hence, of more than a thousand works, his masses, requiems, symphonies,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
overtures, chamber-music, etc., are obsolete, but his educational
works are destined to live. Of many valuable sets of studies, the most
used are those for Velocity, Op. 299, and Finger Training, Op. 740.
Musically, they are of slight importance, but they are invaluable to
this day in acquiring facility. Czerny had an immense knowledge of the
higher mechanism of piano playing, and a keen perception of practical
methods. His fame as a pianist was overshadowed by his ceaseless work

<b>Ignaz Moscheles</b> (1794-1870), described as “the foremost pianist
after Hummel and before Chopin,” was born at Prague. He studied the
piano with Dionys Weber, director of the Prague Conservatory, and at
fourteen played a concerto of his own in public. After the death of his
father, he went to Vienna to make his way as a teacher, and to continue
his studies in composition. He soon became in great demand as a pianist
and teacher, and for ten years lived the life of a traveling virtuoso.
In 1824, he gave lessons to Mendelssohn, then a boy of fifteen, at
Berlin. Soon after his marriage at Hamburg, in 1826, he went to London,
where he remained with some interruptions for nearly twenty years
of activity as pianist, teacher and conductor. In 1845, he took the
post of teacher of the piano at the Leipzig Conservatory, founded by Mendelssohn.</p>

<p><b>Moscheles as Composer and Pianist</b>.—As a composer, Moscheles was
divided between his classical training and his unmistakably romantic
instincts. Hence, a long list of variations, fantasias, rondos, written
to please publishers, in accordance with the fashion of the time,
have not survived, but his best works, the concerto in G minor, the
“Pathetic” concerto, the sonata, Op. 49, his duet for two pianos,
“Hommage á Handel” and especially the studies, Op. 70 and 95, combine a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
respect for classic form with the growing Romantic movement. The
studies may be regarded as the legitimate successors to those of
Cramer, and paved the way for the more romantic etudes of Chopin.
Moscheles was a solidly trained pianist of great brilliancy. He had
many characteristics of the classical school; he used the pedals
sparingly, he played octaves with a stiff wrist, his phrasing was
precise and his accents were sharply marked; but in the brilliant style
he had no rivals. He was famous for his improvisations; his cadenzas to
concertos and his extempore treatments of well-known themes were marked
by spontaneity, brilliance and exquisite feeling.</p>
<p><b>John Field</b> (1782-1837), one of the last connecting links between
the Classical and Romantic schools, was born at Dublin. Early in life,
he was taken to London and apprenticed to Clementi, who gave him
lessons, and employed him to show off his pianos. In 1802, he went on
a concert-tour with Clementi to Paris, Germany and Russia. Field lived
for many years as pianist and teacher at St. Petersburg and Moscow.
After returning to England, he made a long tour through Belgium,
Switzerland, and finally, Italy, where his health gave way. Shortly
after he returned to Moscow, where he died.</p>
<p><b>Field as Composer and Pianist</b>.—Field’s compositions in
classical forms include seven concertos, four sonatas, rondos,
variations, etc. They are forgotten now, although Chopin had a
partiality for his concerto in A-flat and gave it to his pupils; but
his lyric pieces for piano, entitled nocturnes, are still played.
They are the forerunners of the type so extended and developed by
Chopin. He is thus one of the first of the romanticists in spite of
his classical training. In 1802, Field astonished the Parisians by
his masterly playing of Bach and Handel, but his individuality later
took a more romantic turn. His tone was tender and melancholy, and his
phrases gently expressive. Shortly before his death, though broken in
health, he created a stir in Vienna by his interpretations of his own
nocturnes. In some respects his playing was akin to Chopin’s highly individual style.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>
<p><b>To sum up</b>, it will be seen that Clementi was the originator
of a system of technic that has served as the foundation of modern
piano playing; Cramer was the conserver of classic style and purity
of standard; Hummel, as a brilliant pianist, had a decided influence
on the piano playing of his time, but as a composer attempted to pass
superficial brilliance for the true coin of musical substance; Czerny,
one of the greatest educators in the history of piano playing, has had
an immense influence through his invaluable educational works, and as
the teacher of Franz Liszt, the epitome of modern piano playing, and
also of Theodore Leschetizky, possibly the foremost teacher of the
present day; Moscheles, the classic pianist, gave decided impetus to
the cause of romanticism by his best compositions; Field, though the
pupil of Clementi, prepared the way through his own individuality for
the greatest piano composer of the Romantic period, Chopin, and thus
became an important factor in the transition from the Classic to the
Romantic period.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Franz Peter Schubert</span></span>.</h2>
<p>The rise of the Romantic school involves a greater freedom in form, a
fuller play of poetry and imagination, a general artistic evolution and
independence in comparison with the formality of the Classic period.
The struggle to establish these principles was long and obstinate, but
the outcome was as inevitable as the victory won by Beethoven’s sonata
and symphonic forms over the more primitive types of Haydn and Mozart.
The first departures from the classic attitude were made by Schubert,
whose influence has been permanent in the development of romanticism.</p>
<p><b>Schubert’s Early Life</b> (1797-1816).—Franz Peter Schubert was
born in a suburb of Vienna, January 31, 1797. At an early age he had
lessons on the violin from his father, who was a school teacher,
and on the piano, from his elder brother. He so quickly outstripped
both teachers that he was sent to Michael Holzer, choir-master of
the parish, who taught him piano, organ, violin, singing and theory.
In later years, Holzer disclaimed the value of his instruction,
saying: “If I ever wished to teach him anything new, I found he had
already mastered it.” After singing in the parish choir, he passed an
examination for admission to the Imperial <i>Convict</i> or school for the
Royal choristers. The training included general education as well as
music; there was also an orchestra among the boys in which Schubert
played the violin and sometimes conducted. There were privations
connected with life at the <i>Convict</i>, the practice rooms were
insufferably cold, and the food insufficient. In 1810, Schubert began
to compose, dating his pieces carefully, and the only check to his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
inspiration was the lack of music-paper, which he was too poor to
buy. A generous friend made up the deficiency. In 1813, he left the
<i>Convict</i>, although his general education was by no means complete,
since he had neglected his studies on account of his increasing
passion for composition. After leaving the <i>Convict</i>, Schubert taught
elementary classes at his father’s school, but the drudgery became
insupportable. An ardent friend and admirer, Franz von Schober,
realizing that Schubert’s creative powers were greatly hampered by the
conditions of his life, gave him a home. Already he had composed some
of his most famous songs, including “The Erl-King.”</p>
<p><b>Later Years</b> (1816-1828).—From 1816 on, Schubert appears to
have lived in Schober’s apartments, except for two years shared with
the poet Mayerhofer, and a period spent with a friend, Schwind. It
is a mystery how Schubert managed to live, for he taught little, and
his few publications could have brought him at best only small sums
at irregular intervals. He had already failed to secure a position
in a Government school of music, but in 1818 he passed the summer
as music teacher to the household of Count Johann Esterhazy, in
Zelescz, Hungary. The record of his life hereafter is one of incessant
composition, with few interruptions or facts of interest. In 1823, he
showed Weber his eighth work for the stage: “Alfonso and Estrella.” The
only advice he received was that “first operas, like first puppies,
should be drowned.” The summer of 1824 was spent again with the
Esterhazys and many characteristic compositions, such as the quartet in
A minor, the “Hungarian Divertissement,” the piano sonata in B-flat,
etc., date from this time. In 1826, Schubert failed to obtain either
of two positions, which would have placed him above need, the second
because, like Beethoven, he refused to alter a trial aria to suit the
voice of a capricious singer. Schubert was taken to see Beethoven
during his last illness, in 1827. In 1828, he went to live with his
brother Ferdinand in a new and damp house. His health, which had
been troublesome before, now gave way, and he died of typhoid fever,
November 28, 1828, in his thirty-second year.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Personal Traits and Habits of Work</b>.—Schubert was short of
stature, thickset and rather heavy in features. His face in repose
was rather devoid of expression, but when interested in anything, his
eyes glowed with enthusiasm and his whole appearance changed. His
disposition was even and good-tempered, he was simple and trusting by
nature, and could rarely be induced to put himself forward. Although
receiving many favors from friends, his generosity often led him to
give to others when he could ill spare it. He began composing early in
the morning and worked uninterruptedly for several hours; he walked
much in the afternoon or paid visits to friends, spending his evenings
with congenial spirits at various taverns. Composing was the mainspring
of his existence, and he often wrote down his ideas while in the midst
of conversation with others. Thus he wrote his immortal “Serenade” on
the back of a bill-of-fare at a tavern; a piece for four-hands while
waiting at a hospital for a friend, “and dinner missed in consequence”;
a movement of a string quartet was begun about midnight and finished in
the early morning. Although he set many poems by Goethe, Schiller and
Heine, his inspiration was quite as effectively aroused by second-rate
poems of his friends Mayerhofer, von Schober, or the artless poems of
Müller. Schubert was shy and reserved in what might be called “good
society”; he preferred the company of congenial friends in an humbler
social station. He seems to have cared little for literature, and his
love of poetry was limited to its availability as texts for songs.
In early life he played the violin and the viola in a family string
quartet. Schubert was no virtuoso on the piano, but he played exquisite
accompaniments, and he read well at sight in spite of defective
eyesight. His performance was marked by earnestness and attention to
the inner sentiment of the music rather than by the superficial polish
of the mere pianist. It was said that no one could forget the effect
of Schubert’s songs as performed by himself and his friend Vogl; the
two seemed absolutely united, the ideal condition for the rendering of vocal works.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Schubert’s Compositions</b>.—Schubert completed more than eleven
hundred pieces in about eighteen years. Such fertility is unique in
the history of composition, and is scarcely equalled even by Mozart,
whose activity extended over nearly thirty years. Schubert’s powers of
spontaneous invention have never been approached; he composed generally
without making sketches; he seldom revised, for his ideas came faster
than he could write them down. It is impossible to enumerate all
Schubert’s works, but the following comprise the most important: Nine
symphonies, eleven works for the stage, six masses, over seventy
part-songs, choruses, etc., for various combinations, twenty-four
sonatas for piano, fantasies, overtures, variations, marches and dances
for piano duet, impromptus, moments musicals, fantasies, variations
and over two hundred dances for piano solo, two trios for piano and
strings, a quintet for strings and piano, a string quintet and several
string trios, twenty-four string quartets, besides about six hundred
songs with piano accompaniment and occasionally with obligatos for
other instruments. It is obvious that such fertility is not consistent
with evenness of quality; we must pick and choose to find the real
Schubert. However, the symphonies in C and B minor (“Unfinished”),
the string quartets in D minor and G major, several sonatas for
piano, the impromptus, moments musicals, the fantasy in C for piano,
the Hungarian Divertissement, several marches and other compositions
for four hands, many charming two-hand waltzes, and, finally, such
song-cycles as the “Miller-Songs,” the “Winter Journey,” those called
“Swan-Songs” by the publishers, as well as about thirty separate songs
“The Erl-King,” “The Wanderer,” “To Sylvia,” “The Omnipotent,” “The
Young Nun,” the “Serenade,” “Hark! Hark! the Lark,” “Sei mir Gegrüsst,”
“Du bist die Ruh,” “Ave Maria,” “Litany,” and others, are the works
of Schubert which will live. Schubert at his best entrances us by his
wonderful flow of melody, his spontaneity, his symmetrical form, which,
however, is sometimes diffuse. His chief qualities lie in the simple
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
expressiveness of his music, a direct appeal to sincerity of emotion,
and to the sense of the poetic. He began by imitating the form and
style of Mozart and Beethoven; but from his eighteenth year onward
he developed an individuality entirely apart. Despite the virtues
of his instrumental music, his great achievement was the creation
of the German song, in which department he stands unrivalled in the
inexhaustibility of his melody, the variety of mood which they display,
the subtlety and harmonic beauty of his accompaniments, as well as art
in creating vocal effects.</p>
<p><b>Schubert’s Influence on Music</b>.—In abundance of resource,
poetic feeling and true imagination, Schubert has brought new forces
into music. His influence on romantic composers was widespread and
deep. Schumann was a thorough admirer of Schubert. Schumann’s songs
could hardly have come into existence but for those of Schubert, and
the latter’s short pieces for piano were undoubtedly as potent an
inspiration for his piano works. Brahms, too, had a real reverence
for Schubert, that is plainly exhibited in his works. Despite the
differences of their artistic individuality, there are traces of
Schubert in the former’s songs as well as in some of his short piano
pieces. Liszt’s partiality to Schubert was untiring in its zeal. He
played his piano music, transcribed the “Hungarian Divertissement,”
arranged some of the marches for two hands and for orchestra; he made
a version of the fantasy in C for piano and orchestra, which is still
popular; and, finally (perhaps his greatest service to Schubert) he
transcribed no less than fifty-seven of his songs for piano. In this
form he created an interest in Schubert where the original versions
were unknown, and did much to spread their renown. In spite of all
shortcomings, Schubert’s genius was so remarkable, and his immediate
effect upon the Romantic movement so apparent and his legacy to the
musical world so imperishable that it is difficult not to agree with
Sir George Grove when he wrote: “There has never been one like him and
there never will be another.”

<h2>LESSON XLIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Weber. Mendelssohn</span></span>.</h2>
<p>Schubert’s operas had no appreciable effect on the Romantic composers,
for the simple reason that they were never heard on account of the
absurdities of their librettos and the weakness of their stage
situations. At about the same period, a slightly older composer was
beginning a series of works destined to place German Opera on a firm
basis, to exercise a decided influence on Wagner, besides contributing
not a little to the development of piano technic.</p>
<p><b>Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber</b> was born at Eutin, December
18, 1786. His father, a restless man of many talents, was a theatrical
manager during Weber’s early years, when constant traveling was the
rule, and music lessons the exception. His irregular early instruction
under several teachers, of whom Michael Haydn was the most eminent, was
supplemented by two years of solid study under the gifted and eccentric
Abbé Vogler. From 1804 to 1806, Weber was music-director at the Breslau
theatre, and soon made a name for himself as composer and pianist as
well as conductor. After this he remained under the protection of the
Duke of Wurtemburg, earning a living by giving lessons, and acting as
secretary to the Duke’s brother. During this period he composed an
opera “Silvana,” overtures, a cantata, piano music, etc. Three years
of wandering, chiefly on concert tours, ensued after his banishment
from Wurtemburg on account of unjustly suspected complicity in an
intrigue for a position at court. To these years belong a comic opera,
“Abu Hassan,” the piano concertos in C and E-flat, three concertos for
clarinet, the piano sonata in C, etc. In 1814 and 1815, he composed the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
choruses, “Lyre and Sword,” and a cantata, “Battle and Victory,”
both the outcome of political events, and widely popular from their
patriotic character. In 1816, he became music-director of the German
opera at Dresden. He revived interest in German opera, stimulated
public support and in the following years began the composition of
“Der Freischütz,” an opera thoroughly German in its character and the
keystone of Weber’s fame. It was not finished until 1820, for in the
meantime he wrote much of his best piano music, songs and incidental
music for a gipsy play “Preciosa.” Just after the completion of his
popular Concert-piece for piano and orchestra, “Der Freischütz” was
given for the first time at Berlin, June 18, 1821, and the result was
one of the greatest triumphs ever bestowed on a German composer. It
was soon given in all the principal theatres in Germany, including
Dresden, and also in Vienna. In 1823, Weber’s most ambitious opera,
“Euryanthe,” was given in Vienna and proved almost a failure. Weber’s
health, which had not been satisfactory for some years, showed signs
of being undermined. “Euryanthe” was performed with greater success
during 1824 and 1825, at Dresden, Leipzig and Berlin, where Weber was
almost too ill to conduct. In spite of his ill-health he agreed to
write an opera for the Covent Garden Theatre, in London, beginning the
music to “Oberon” early in 1825 and finishing the last number in the
spring of 1826. The performances were more than satisfactory, and Weber
was received everywhere with enthusiasm. His strength was now entirely
overtaxed, and he hoped to return to his family, but he died suddenly
from consumption, on June 4, 1826.</p>
<p><b>Weber’s personality</b> was pleasing; of excellent birth, his
experience of the world through his positions as opera-director and his
frequent concert-tours, made him an agreeable companion and a favorite
in society. He was cultivated, well read in philosophy and science; he
possessed considerable literary and critical ability. In consequence
of his intellectual and social gifts, he was a new type of musician,
who did much to improve the social status of the composer. He was a
remarkable pianist, with an immense command of technic, original in
style and eloquent in expression; also a forceful conductor.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Weber the Composer</b>.—Weber is, first of all, the composer of the
three operas, “Der Freischütz,” “Euryanthe” and “Oberon,” which are
discussed in Lesson XXXVII. The overtures to his operas are his best
orchestral works; his symphonies and chamber-music are unimportant.
However, his three concertos for clarinet and orchestra are classics
in the literature of that instrument. Weber’s songs are interesting
for the sidelight they throw on the development of the Folk-song
tendency, but in this line he was entirely overshadowed by Schubert
and Schumann. However, Weber’s piano music is exceedingly important.
The concertos for piano are seldom heard, but the “Concert-piece” is
still amply worth study. The piano sonatas (especially those in C and
A-flat) show great technical inventiveness, melodic charm and original
effects, but they are less happy in point of form. Next to the sonatas
in interest comes the delightful Op. 65, “Invitation to the Dance,” so
well-known in Berlioz’ orchestral version. In addition are the “Momento
Capriccioso,” Op. 12, the Rondo in E-flat, Op. 62, the “Polacca
Brillante,” Op. 72, the Polonaise, Op. 21. Weber did much to develop
the technic of the left hand; his piano compositions are thoroughly
pianistic and rank high in the music of the Romantic period.</p>
<p><b>Weber’s Influence</b>.—Weber’s position in the evolution of the
Romantic school is extremely important. In Opera his exploration of
the imaginative field in so many directions not only opened a new
vein in dramatic music, but its influence was felt in every branch of
composition. Thus several of Schumann’s choral works, Mendelssohn’s
“Midsummer Night’s Dream” music, the “Walpurgis Night” cantata, the
concert overtures, and pieces for piano and orchestra are direct
musical descendants of Weber. Mendelssohn’s Concerto in G minor, the
“Serenade” and “Allegro Giojoso,” his scherzos and “Songs Without
Words” are the direct outcome of Weber’s example. In general, the
technical style of Weber’s piano music was thoroughly absorbed by both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Mendelssohn and, to some extent, Liszt, who edited Weber’s sonatas
and solo pieces with tempting additions; he transcribed for piano
the overtures “Jubilee,” “Freischütz” and “Oberon,” and arranged the
“Polacca Brillante,” Op. 72, for piano and orchestra. Liszt was very
fond of Weber’s music, his piano style was sympathetic to him, his
interpretation of the Concert-piece, Op. 79, never failed to produce
an overwhelming effect. Finally, Weber’s influence on Wagner must
be mentioned. Wagner greatly admired Weber’s dramatic insight, his
picturesqueness, and especially the poetry and novel color of his
orchestral style.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mendelssohn</span>.</h3>
<p>The influence which Mendelssohn exercised during two-thirds of the
19th century among the more conservative German musicians and in
England was nothing short of extraordinary. He undoubtedly gave great
impetus to the study of the classic masters, especially Bach, and his
romantic tendencies were so balanced and controlled as to gain a speedy
recognition for his music. Today, Mendelssohn the classicist is less
admired, and his music will live chiefly for its romantic qualities.</p>
<p><b>Mendelssohn’s Life</b>.—Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a>
was born at Hamburg, February 3, 1809. His father, a prosperous banker,
moved to Berlin in 1811. His first lessons in music were given him by
his mother, but he soon began to study the piano with Ludwig Berger, a
pupil of Clementi, and composition with Zelter. In 1820, he began to
compose systematically. In 1821, he made the acquaintance of Weber,
and his enthusiasm for the romantic composer lasted all his life. In
1824, he formed a life-long friendship with Moscheles, who gave him
piano lessons. Already he was remarkable for his improvisations and for
playing from scores. In 1825, a trip to Paris brought him into contact
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
with the celebrated musicians there. In this year he composed his
octet for strings, in which his individuality first asserted itself
strongly. In the following summer he wrote the overture to “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” a precocious evidence of originality. In 1827, he made
the first draft of his overture “A Calm Sea and a Prosperous Voyage,”
a further step into the realm of imagination. In 1829, he organized
the first performance of Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion” music since
the composer’s death. In this year a visit to England, where some of
his compositions were performed, was followed by a trip to Scotland,
the Hebrides and Wales, of which his impressions are recorded in the
“Hebrides” overture, the “Scotch” symphony and other works of later
years. He traveled much during the following years. In 1833, after
another visit to England, where his recently composed “Italian”
symphony was played, he conducted a musical festival at Düsseldorf, the
first of many similar engagements. During the next few years he was
constantly employed in conducting, playing and composing, especially
his oratorio “St. Paul.” In 1837, he married Miss Cécile Jeanrenaud.
From this time dates his second piano concerto in D minor, in which are
to be seen traces of Thalberg’s piano style. During the next few years
Mendelssohn lived at Leipzig. In 1843, he established a conservatory
at Leipzig, long the most celebrated in Europe. Schumann, and later
Moscheles, were among the teachers as well as Mendelssohn himself. In
1846, Mendelssohn’s oratorio “Elijah” was given a triumphant first
performance at Birmingham under the composer’s direction. In 1847,
he made his tenth visit to England for performances of “Elijah,” of
his completed “Midsummer Night’s Dream” music (composed in 1845), the
“Scotch” symphony and other works. The death of his sister, Fanny,
following soon after those of his parents, was so great a shock to
him that he went to Switzerland for a rest. He returned improved in
health, but could not consider commissions for new works from England,
Frankfort and Cologne. He was considering a trip to Vienna to hear
Jenny Lind sing in “Elijah” when he was taken suddenly ill and died, November 4, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
<b>Personal Traits</b>.—Mendelssohn is described as having an
unusually animated, winning personality. He was immensely fond of
society, which he could enjoy without detriment to his work. His
letters describe in detail his innumerable professional engagements,
his round of social festivities and his journeys with equal fidelity.
Mendelssohn was fond of out-of-door life, walking, riding and swimming;
he also greatly enjoyed dancing. One of his favorite relaxations was
to sketch from nature or paint in water-colors. Mendelssohn was a
remarkable pianist, of an unaffected type, not a virtuoso, yet his
interpretations were full of vigor, charm and a thoroughly musical
spirit. His improvisations were remarkable for their spontaneous
invention, brilliance and science displayed, and his cadenzas to
Beethoven’s 4th concerto and Mozart’s, in D minor, were striking
examples of his skill. Mendelssohn was also a remarkable organist, if
English testimony is to be credited. At all events, he did much to
further the knowledge of Bach’s organ works. Mendelssohn’s incessant
activity undoubtedly hastened his death; the amount that he compressed
into his short life was incredible.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Compositions</b>.—The works most
representative of Mendelssohn are the “Scotch” and “Italian”
symphonies, the overtures “A Calm Sea and a Prosperous Voyage,” “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “The Hebrides,” “Melusina,” “Ruy Blas”; the
concertos and two smaller pieces for piano and orchestra; the concerto
for violin; the octet for strings; two quintets and seven quartets;
three quartets for piano and strings; two trios; two sonatas for piano
and ’cello; for the piano, six preludes and fugues; three sonatas; the
“Serious Variations”; six books of “Songs Without Words”; many smaller
pieces, including the “Capriccio,” Op. 8; the “Rondo Capriccioso,” Op.
14; the Caprices, Op. 33; the Scherzo à Capriccio and others; sonatas,
preludes and fugues for organ; the oratorios “St. Paul,” and “Elijah”;
music to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” to the dramas “Athalie,”
“Antigone” and “Œdipus”; the cantata “Walpurgis Night.” He also wrote
a great deal of church music, psalms, hymns, motets, and cantatas for
various occasions, including the “Lobgesang,” a symphony-cantata; many
part-songs, duets and songs for single voice with piano accompaniment.

<b>Mendelssohn’s Tendencies</b>.—Although he wrote almost exclusively
in the conventional forms, Mendelssohn cannot be regarded as
a continuator of the classics. In form, thematic development,
counterpoint, part-writing, etc., he imitated the letter of classic
example closely, but could not attain the inner spirit. To some extent
he followed Bach, Handel, Mozart and Beethoven, but the chief source
of his individuality is the romanticism of Weber. His piano style is
adapted from that of Weber with some extensions of his own. Showered
with praise as he was during his lifetime, as the possessor of all
the classic virtues, we now admire him chiefly for his romanticism,
timid and fastidious though it appears by comparison with the genuine
innovations of Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. In the light of the sturdy
qualities of Brahms, his classicism seems superficial. His style was
too polished to admit of real vigor. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn of
the two symphonies, the “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Melusina” and
“Hebrides” overture, the violin concerto, the piano concerto in G
minor, the sonata for piano and ’cello in D, the scherzo of the octet,
the “Serious Variations,” the Scherzo à Capriccio and some half a
dozen of the “Songs Without Words” shows us a delicate and charming
individuality with the refinement and decided perceptions of the poet,
who regarded the world with the eyes of a romanticist recording many
impressions of picturesqueness and grace, if seldom of strength.</p>
<p><b>Mendelssohn’s Influence as an Artist</b>.—For a time, Mendelssohn’s
influence was unbounded. His symphonies and overtures were considered
worthy successors to those of Beethoven; his chamber-music was equally
valued; his oratorios were regarded as on a level with those of
Handel; his piano music, especially the “Songs Without Words,” were in
universal vogue. His orchestral style contained many novel features, it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
is true, but his chamber-music was not written in the genuine manner
and is far inferior to that of the later master, Brahms. His oratorios
contain some notable choruses and airs, but on the whole are only faint
imitations of the real oratorio style. Still they sufficed to form the
foundation of an English school of composition in this form. His piano
music contains much that is trivial, but at its best undoubtedly did
something to prepare the way for the deeper romanticism of Schumann,
Chopin and Liszt. His songs also have far less variety of mood and
lyric inspiration than those of Schubert and Schumann, but they too
acted as prophets of the more vital creations to follow.</p>
<p>That this reverence for Mendelssohn was no mere infatuation of the
moment but a sober respect can best be judged from the diversity in
nationality and temperament of those who came under his influence:
Gade, the Norwegian; Sterndale Bennett, the English composer and
pianist; Hiller and Reinecke among the Germans, and Rubinstein from
Russia. These names constitute but a small proportion of Mendelssohn’s
disciples, his personality dominated musical England in every branch
of composition for many years; and English composers are only just
beginning to throw off the yoke of adherence to the traditional
oratorio form as exhibited in “St. Paul” and “Elijah.” Schumann admired
Mendelssohn without reserve and without a suggestion of jealousy,
although the tide of popular favor neglected him for his more easily
understood contemporary. Today, criticism has swung possibly too far in
the opposite direction, and Mendelssohn suffers from depreciation.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLIV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Robert Schumann</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Romantic Movement before Schumann</b>.—Schubert gave a decided
impetus to the Romantic movement through his spontaneous melody and
deep fund of imagination. He infused poetry into the classic forms, his
piano works in the small forms showed the way to future achievement in
these lines, but especially he founded German song, which had scarcely
been hinted at by Mozart and Beethoven. Although Weber extended the
province of piano technic, and exhibited further possibilities of
romantic feeling in combination with the rondo and sonata forms, his
chief work was the realization of German opera, elsewhere described.
But still another German was destined to contribute richly to
romantic piano literature, to prove no mean successor to Schubert
in the province of song, and to add further proofs of his genius in
chamber-music, choral works and the symphony.</p>
<p><b>Schumann’s Early life</b>.—Robert Alexander Schumann was born at
Zwickau, in Saxony, June 8, 1810. His father was a bookseller with
some attainments as an author. Schumann’s gift for music asserted
itself early. He had piano lessons from a local organist at the age of
six, and began to compose soon after. A taste for improvisation also
developed. For several years his literary interests were as pronounced
as those for music. He read assiduously, and was especially devoted to
poetry. His general education was continued at the Zwickau Academy,
where he studied until 1828. In 1827, he came under the joint influence
of the writings of Jean Paul (Richter) the poet and novelist, and of
Schubert’s music, both of which played an important part in his mental
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
and artistic growth. In 1828, he entered the University of Leipzig
with the intention of studying law. He kept up his music, however, and
not only became enthusiastic over the clavier works of Bach, but took
piano lessons of Friedrich Wieck, a celebrated teacher in Leipzig. In
1829, Schumann went to Heidelberg. Here he continued his law studies
in a desultory fashion, but worked with the greatest persistence at
piano playing. In 1830, he resolved to study law with more seriousness,
but it was intensely repugnant to him, and after some reflection,
he determined, with Wieck’s advice, to adopt music as a profession.
Accordingly, he returned to Leipzig to study the piano with Wieck,
but having the misfortune to injure a finger in his zeal for speedy
perfection, he was obliged to forego the career of a virtuoso, perhaps
to the great gain of music.</p>
<p><b>Schumann’s Professional Career</b>.—He now devoted his attention
to thorough study of composition with Heinrich Dorn. In 1834, Schumann
founded the “New Journal of Music” in the interests of a higher
critical standard, and the furtherance of worthy compositions. During
ten years of editorship, Schumann found abundant outlet for his
literary interests, and his paper exerted a considerable force on
public opinion. Two of his greatest piano works, the Carnival, Op. 9,
and the Symphonic Studies, Op. 13, belong to the year 1834. During
the years 1836 and 1837, he had some intimacy with Mendelssohn. From
1836-39 date most of Schumann’s important works for the piano. In 1840,
Schumann married Wieck’s daughter, Clara, the celebrated pianist,
after several years’ struggle to gain her father’s consent. Schumann’s
marriage was the turning-point in his artistic career, and his wife’s
sympathy was a great stimulus to his creative activity. In the year
following his marriage, Schumann turned to song-composing, producing
more than one hundred songs in this period. In 1841, he gave himself up
wholly to orchestral composition, writing his symphony in B-flat, the
first draft of his D minor symphony, a third work, afterwards published
as Overture, Scherzo and Finale, as well as the first movement of his
piano concerto. In 1842, he confined himself almost exclusively to
chamber-music, composing three string quartets, the masterly quintet,
Op. 44, the quartet, Op. 47, for piano and strings, and a trio. To
1845 belong the “Variations” for two pianos, and a large choral work,
“Paradise and the Peri.” In 1844, Schumann began the music to Goethe’s
“Faust,” but ill-health interrupted him for more than a year. However,
in 1845 he completed the piano concerto, wrote several works for pedal
piano, and in 1846 finished his second symphony. In 1847, he began his
opera “Genoveva,” which was not given until 1850. Late in 1850 he went
to Düsseldorf to take a position as director. While here he composed
his third symphony. In the following years he wrote several overtures,
works for solo instruments and orchestra, the overture and incidental
music to Byron’s “Manfred,” “The Pilgrimage of the Rose” and many
other choral works, including a Mass and a Requiem. Early in 1854,
symptoms of a mental disorder, which had been increasing of late years,
culminated in an attempt at suicide. He passed the remaining years of
his life in an asylum near Bonn, where he died July 29, 1856.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
<b>Schumann’s Personality</b>.—By reason of his two-fold activity
as critic and composer, Schumann was a new force in music. Highly
cultivated in literature, philosophy and poetry, he possessed a
keen and discerning critical taste, and a literary style that was
picturesque and eloquent. Schumann was shy and reserved by nature, he
talked little but observed and reflected abundantly. He was never fond
of society, and as years went by he lived more and more like a hermit,
absorbed in composition and family life. For ten years, however, he
was in touch with the public by reason of his editorship of the “New
Journal,” and by his championship therein of all that was good and
progressive in the music of the day, did much for the encouragement of
true art. His articles on Schubert, Mendelssohn, Gade, Chopin, Berlioz,
Liszt, Brahms and others formed a new epoch in musical criticism, and
helped the cause of Romanticism immeasurably. No estimate of Schumann’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
character is complete without taking into account these distinct
tendencies as critic and composer. His collected writings give a
graphic illustration of his views on music, and form a supplement to
his personality as expressed in his music.</p>
<p><b>Schumann’s Compositions</b>.—Schumann’s most representative works
include four symphonies and the “Overture, Scherzo and Finale,” the
overtures “Genoveva” and “Manfred”; three string quartets, a piano
quintet, a piano quartet, three piano trios and two sonatas for piano
and violin; the music to “Faust” and “Manfred”; “Paradise and the
Peri,” “The Pilgrimage of the Rose” and other works for solos, chorus
and orchestra; more than two hundred songs; the piano concerto and two
smaller works for piano and orchestra, besides a monumental series
of works for piano alone. In addition there are duets, part-songs,
choruses, pieces for piano duet, a concert piece for four horns and
orchestra, a concerto for ’cello and orchestra, a fantasy for violin
and orchestra, besides short pieces for oboe, viola, clarinet and
’cello with piano accompaniment, the opera “Genoveva,” the overtures
“The Bride of Messina,” “Julius Cæsar” and “Herman and Dorothea,” the
Mass, Op. 147, and the Requiem, Op. 148.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Schumann wrote much in the sonata or symphonic
form, yet his command of it was far from complete. In this respect and
in instrumentation, Schumann was inferior to his romantic contemporary,
Mendelssohn. On the other hand, he was far more original and his music
has a much greater depth of sentiment, a higher sense of beauty and
a noble human breadth that forms one of the highest points in the
development of romanticism. What he lacked in technical attainment,
he more than made up in beauty of themes, vigor and spontaneity of
treatment, and thorough-going romanticism in moods. It is difficult to
say which is his best symphony, they all have merits of their own; of
the overtures, that to “Genoveva” (almost the only surviving portion of
the opera) and “Manfred” are examples of Schumann’s ardent romanticism
at its best. The string-quartets are not always in quartet style and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
their structure is sometimes open to criticism, but they are individual
and contain much that is beautiful. The piano-quartet is a genial work
of great spontaneity that took Europe by storm. It was immediately
hailed as the greatest work since Beethoven, although its position
might now be assailed by the piano quintets by Brahms and César Franck.
The piano quartet, as well as the quintet, is a pioneer in this form
of chamber-music, but has not the same flow of melody as the former.
The trios and sonatas for violin and piano, although not on a level
with the other chamber-music, have nevertheless striking qualities to
commend them. Schumann’s choral music is decidedly unequal, but the
“Paradise and the Peri,” and portions of the “Faust” and “Manfred”
music display the same breadth of human emotion so characteristic of
his best music. In the field of song, Schumann is a worthy successor
to Schubert. Schumann’s songs have not the inexhaustible melody of
Schubert’s, but they are richer harmonically, the accompaniments more
individual, and the character of the poems more subtly brought out.</p>
<p><b>Schumann’s Contribution to the Short Piece</b>.—Perhaps Schumann’s
most conspicuous service to music lies in his development of the short
piece. In this direction he has cultivated a branch of expression,
with an originality, a freedom and a richness that have no parallel
in the Romantic movement except in Chopin. Mendelssohn undoubtedly
did something for the short piece, but his “Songs Without Words” are
limited to a few types, while Schumann made the short form serve every
variety of expression. He undoubtedly owed much to the examples of
Schubert with his waltzes and other dances, the impromptus and moments
musicals, but in richness of resource and spontaneity of expression
he went much beyond the older master. His piano style is highly
distinctive; it does not offer much that is new in finger technic, but
in polyphonic treatment of melodies, in striking rhythms and harmonic
effects and in original use of the pedal it is remarkable. Both in the
sets of small pieces, such as the “Papillons,” Op. 2, the “Davidsbund
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
Dances,” Op. 6, the “Carnival,” Op. 9, or the Flower pieces, Op. 19,
and in the Novellettes, Op. 21, the Fantasie pieces, Op. 12, the
Symphonic Studies, Op. 15, the Toccata, Op. 7, and the great Fantasy,
Op. 17, Schumann displays a wealth of imaginative poetry that makes him
one of the greatest romanticists in piano music. His piano works from
Op. 2 to Op. 28 are matchless, although the sonatas, Op. 11 and 22,
suffer from lack of coherence. The variations for two pianos, Op. 46,
and the concerto, Op. 54, are models of their type. The “Album for the
Young,” Op. 68, the “Forest Scenes,” Op. 82, the “Varied Leaves,” Op.
99, and the “Album Leaves,” Op. 124, are all admirable, and contain a
great variety of short pieces, many of which were composed early in his
career. Schumann’s songs and piano pieces are the best examples of his
contribution to romanticism.</p>
<p>Schubert and Jean Paul Richter (the romantic novelist and poet)
were the earliest influences in Schumann’s studies, nevertheless he
admired Beethoven greatly, and shut himself up with his quartets as
a preparation for his own chamber-music. As a student in Leipzig, he
was devoted to Bach’s clavier works, and later in life he renewed
his enthusiasm for Bach while writing the works for pedal piano and
the piano fugues. Fugal form and romantic sentiment do not go well
together, however, and Schumann’s compositions in this form are not his
greatest. Schumann’s influence is strongest upon composers of songs
and short piano pieces. It would be difficult to name even the most
representative, but the most signal example is Brahms, whose songs and
piano pieces could hardly exist but for Schumann. In many of the modern
Russian composers we find distinct traces of Schumann, as well as
among the Frenchmen Gabriel Fauré and Vincent d’Indy, the German Adolf
Jensen, the Italian Sgambati, and many others.</p>
<p><b>Compositions Suggested for Study</b>.—The symphonies, overtures,
the chamber-music and the larger choral works are all characteristic
of Schumann at his best, but for more detailed study of his piano
music and songs the following are suggested. Of the piano works, the

<h2>LESSON XLV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Frederic Chopin</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Schumann and Chopin</b>.—Among Schumann’s many able reviews of new
music, showing the keenest critical insight, none exhibit a more just
appreciation of an original talent than his article on some variations
by a young composer who was destined to exert so deep and widespread an
influence on piano style and piano composition. Chopin’s romanticism,
somewhat affected at first by both Hummel and Field, is one of the most
individual developments of the entire period.</p>
<p><b>Chopin’s Early life</b>.—Frederic Chopin was born at Zelazowa-Wola,
near Warsaw, in Poland, on March 1, 1809. His father, who had served in
various positions as a teacher, finally established a boarding-school
in Warsaw. Chopin showed great sensitiveness towards music at an
early age. His first lessons on the piano were given him by a Polish
teacher of some celebrity, Adalbert Zwyny. He soon became famous as a
pianist, and from the age of nine, played constantly at the houses of
the nobility, and was eagerly received by them. In 1824, he entered
the Warsaw Lyceum in order to pursue his general studies. About the
same time he began lessons in composition with Elsner, who had a high
reputation as a teacher. He had already composed pieces for the piano
on his own account, and continued with such success that as early as
1825 his Op. 1, a Rondo, was published. In 1827, he left the Lyceum,
and gave thereafter all his time to playing and composing. Soon after,
he made great strides in composition, and many of his studies and
smaller pieces, as well as his two concertos, belong to this period,
or were begun then. Early in 1829, Hummel played in Warsaw, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
influence of his piano style is evident in the works of Chopin for some
time to come. Later in this year, Chopin went to Vienna, where he gave
two concerts, winning instant recognition both as pianist and composer.
After his return to Warsaw he continued to compose much.</p>
<p><b>Chopin’s Manhood</b>.—A second visit to Vienna occurred toward the
end of 1830. He gave concerts, came into contact with many musicians,
and even found time to compose; but being dissatisfied with conditions
in Vienna, determined to go to Paris. Early in 1831, after giving
concerts on the way, he arrived at Paris, which was henceforth to be
his home. Here he was soon thrown with many of the leading musicians,
his playing caused an immediate sensation, and as at Warsaw, he was
welcomed in the most exclusive society. In 1832, he began to acquire
fame as a piano teacher, especially of pupils from the aristocracy.
From 1833 to 1835, his compositions began to appear, and gained him
much approval as a composer. In 1835, he went to Leipzig, where he
saw Wieck and his daughter, afterwards Clara Schumann, Mendelssohn
and Schumann. In 1837, he met Madame George Sand, the famous writer,
whose influence on his life was so great. During this year the first
sinister symptoms of ill-health made their appearance. With the idea
of benefiting his health, Chopin passed the winter of 1838-39 on the
island of Majorca, with Madame Sand and her two children. The climate
had a bad effect upon him; he could compose but little, and the
condition of his lungs obliged a return to France. He was so ill as to
be obliged to spend several months at Marseilles, recuperating. After
a summer at Nohant, Mme. Sand’s country home, he was again at Paris in
the fall of 1839. From 1840 to 1848, he lived in Paris, with occasional
visits to Nohant in the summer, teaching as much as his health would
allow, passing much time in the most aristocratic society. He seldom
played in public, and would only play for pupils, or when persuaded by
devoted friends to display his extraordinary gifts as a pianist. During
these years, however, his health grew more and more precarious.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Last Years of Chopin</b>.—In 1847, the intimacy of Chopin and
Madame Sand came to an end, for various causes, but largely because of
a character caricatured from Chopin in one of Madame Sand’s novels, and
because she was tired of taking care of him. Ill as he was, he went
to England, after a farewell concert in Paris, arriving in the spring
of 1848. He gave two concerts in London with some success, besides
playing at friends’ houses. He went to Scotland at the instance of a
pupil, Miss Stirling, gave concerts at Edinburgh and Glasgow, besides
one in the interval at Manchester. During this entire tour he suffered
greatly from ill-health and exhaustion, and after one more appearance
in London, he returned to Paris, exceedingly ill, in January, 1849. He
was not able to teach and was obliged to depend upon the generosity
of friends; among them his pupil, Miss Stirling. After several months
of hopeless struggle to regain his health, he died of consumption on
October 17, 1849, surrounded by devoted friends.</p>
<p><b>Chopin’s Personality</b>.—Chopin was extremely refined and delicate
by nature. He was fastidious about the color and fit of his clothes,
the furnishing and arrangement of his rooms, and other details of
everyday life. He was always extremely fond of society and moved
in the highest circles. As a rule, he was averse to seeing much of
musicians, in spite of his friendship with Liszt, Hiller, Berlioz and
Schumann. As a young man he was fond of dancing, acting and practical
jokes; though sensitive, he was well and strong, and able to endure
rough stage-journeys. He was a capital mimic all his life, and a witty
companion who pleased by his gentle irony or sarcasm. He was extremely
reserved in spite of his sociability, his intimate friends (either
Polish or favorite pupils) even quarrelled as to which knew him best.
He was genuinely confidential only in his music. Chopin was exceedingly
patriotic; he was always ready to appear in concert in behalf of Polish
refugees, he corresponded untiringly with his Polish friends, and gave
many proofs of his devotion to Poland, which he never forgot in spite
of years of absence.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Chopin as Pianist</b>.—Chopin was a pianist of extraordinary
distinction, in spite of the preëminence of Liszt. His technic, founded
in the school of Clementi and Cramer, with great attention to Bach, was
influenced to some extent by Hummel and Field, but later became highly
original, and expressive of great individuality. Although he possessed
great brilliancy, the most prominent trait in his playing was its
all-pervading and inexhaustible fund of poetry. It had nothing harsh,
unmelodious or ungraceful. His sense of rhythm was unusually piquant,
and one of its features was the skilful use of <i>tempo rubato</i>, a slight
variance from strict time without disturbing it fundamentally. In later
life, Chopin became disinclined to appear in public, his performances
were limited to the drawing-rooms of aristocratic friends, where he
would play or improvise for hours. He was never a robust pianist at his
strongest, and the transparent delicacy of his playing during his last
years was almost incredible.</p>
<p><b>Chopin’s Compositions</b>.—Chopin’s music constitutes the true
revelation of himself. His life, not full of action, was, however, rich
in emotion and sentiment of great variety and subtlety. Its mainsprings
were his patriotic love of Poland and everything connected with it,
and the poetic impressionability of his temperament, which were all
transferred to his music. Although Chopin composed a number of works in
which he uses the orchestra, some chamber-music, and a set of Polish
songs, he was first and last a composer for the piano. In addition to
the works referred to, he wrote three sonatas, four ballades, four
scherzos, ten polonaises, fourteen waltzes, twenty-eight studies,
fifty-five mazurkas, twenty-five preludes, seventeen nocturnes, three
impromptus and a fantasie-impromptu, three rondos, besides a superb
fantasy, a concert allegro, a barcarolle, a berceuse, a tarantelle, a
bolero, a rondo for two pianos, and a few trifles.</p>
<p>Of his two concertos, the second published (although the first
composed) is the finer. It is riper and more poetic, the slow movement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
reaches a high point of lyric style, and the treatment of form
throughout the concerto is less awkward. Chopin is not at home in the
sonata form, the concertos are interesting in spite of, rather than
on account of, their treatment of form. The piano sonatas, Op. 35 and
58, have faults of structure, and occasional incoherence, but they are
so full of poetry, romantic melody and dramatic mood that one almost
overlooks their technical shortcomings.</p>
<p><b>Chopin Most Successful in Free Forms</b>.—The most representative
works of Chopin are those in which he adopts no conventional form, but
follows his own instinct entirely. Thus, in his ballades, scherzos,
and especially in the fantasy, Op. 49, one finds freedom of invention
and variety of treatment combined with logical development and real
coherence. The ballads are dramatic poems in which sentiment and
virtuosity are happily united. The scherzos are original conceptions
quite distinct from the accepted type; they have bold outlines, variety
of mood and demand virtuosity in their performance. The fantasy
is instructive in its logical structure, there is no sign of the
constraint of the sonatas, and its contents are both dramatic on a
large scale and lyric by contrast. The impromptus are shorter pieces
of a lyric nature, although the element of virtuosity is not lacking.
The nocturnes are lyric pieces of simple form but intimate style.
Their general plan was at first copied from Field, but the imitator
went so far ahead of his model as almost to eclipse it. Some of them
portray idyllic moods, others are sentimental or even dramatic in their
outlines. The studies, Op. 10 and 25, epitomize in a remarkable way
Chopin’s technical innovations, and piano style. They are brilliant,
poetic and highly dramatic by turns, and in their contents are the most
musical studies composed up to their time.</p>
<p><b>National Spirit in Chopin’s Music</b>.—Chopin, the patriot, was
devoted to the dances and Folk-melodies of his own country. He was
thoroughly national as a composer; hence in some respects his mazurkas
and polonaises are the most characteristic of his compositions. The
mazurkas with their vital rhythms and novel harmonies, contain much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
poetry of mood and variety of expression within small limits. The
polonaise, as treated by Chopin, was less a dance form, and more an
independent form with characteristic rhythms. The polonaises, Op. 44
and 53, are virtually patriotic poems. The preludes are sketches of
varying size; some are genuine lyrics; some frankly technical in their
object; others have a distinct touch of the dramatic. Some of the
waltzes suggest the <i>salon</i>, but in others Chopin has individualized
the type until it has risen above its origin. Among the single
pieces, the Concert Allegro is large in dimensions, very interesting
technically and musically. The Barcarolle, in nocturne-form on a larger
scale, is almost heroic in its outlines, and a superb example of his
mature style. Another piece equally deserving of distinction is the
Berceuse, an ingenious series of variations on a persistent bass. The
Tarantelle and Bolero are merely fascinating salon pieces.</p>
<p>Of the youthful works with orchestra, the variations on a theme from
Mozart’s “Don Juan” are more interesting from the novelty of their
piano styles than as variations; the Fantasie on Polish themes attracts
attention chiefly on account of its Folk-song character, while the
“Krakowiak” rondo is remarkable for its spirited national-dance
rhythms. The orchestral accompaniments to these pieces are not
significant; in fact, Chopin’s use of the orchestra was his weakest
point. The Polish songs are unequal, and at best add little to his
fame. Liszt, however, has transcribed six, of which two are frequently
heard in concert, while Sgambati has arranged one.</p>
<p><b>Originality and Freshness of Invention</b>.—The most extraordinary
trait of Chopin as a composer is that, in spite of the limitations
imposed by repeating the same form over and over again, he is almost
inexhaustible in variety of expression. As the poet of lyric mood he
accomplished almost as much as Schumann for the development of the
short piece, while in his longer pieces of dramatic mood and large
contours he has shown that the sonata-form is not the only structure by
which to convey heroic sentiment. His was the most subtle originality,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
the most personal style which stamped itself indelibly on nearly every
composition. He immeasurably broadened the technical treatment of the
piano, not only as a virtuoso, but in the direction of variety of
expression, delicate accentuation and exquisite tone. Among romantic
composers he has done more for the advancement of piano style than
anyone except Liszt. In spite of the latter’s gigantic achievement,
the value of Chopin’s contribution is still unimpaired. From the point
of view of expression, Chopin is more individual even than Schumann,
but the honors as the most important composer for the piano during
the Romantic period must be divided between them. Chopin’s influence
has been immense not only on the composers and pianists of France and
Germany but also markedly among living composers in Russia. Chopin is
the preëminent poet of the piano.</p>
<p><b>Representative Compositions</b>.—The following list for the student
contains the works and pieces most thoroughly characteristic of his
genius: The sonatas, Op. 35 and 38; the scherzos, Op. 20, 31 and 39;
the ballades, Op. 23, 38, 47 and 52; the polonaises, Op. 22, 26, 40,

<h2>LESSON XLVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Franz Liszt</span></span>.</h2>
<p>The piano music of Chopin and Schumann reached the highest level
attained during the Romantic period, in subtle originality of style and
deep human sentiment, respectively. Notwithstanding their preëminence
in these particulars, a master was destined to come who summed up the
entire development of piano technic in his achievements, the greatest
virtuoso of the century, to whose influence all piano playing since has
been obliged to acknowledge its indebtedness. In addition, his services
in breaking away from symphonic tradition, in achieving propaganda for
various composers of epoch-making works, including Wagner, in giving up
himself as teacher without remuneration, are equally significant.</p>
<p><b>Liszt’s Early Life</b>.—Franz Liszt was born October 22, 1811,
at Raiding, Hungary. His mother was of Austrian birth; his father, a
Hungarian, occupying an official position on the estates of Prince
Esterhazy, was devoted to music. Liszt was a somewhat delicate child
of acute sensibilities, especially in the direction of music. At the
age of six he received piano lessons from his father. The intensity
of his interest in music and his phenomenal progress soon showed the
uncommon extent of his gifts. At the age of nine, he gave his first
concert before an audience composed largely of Hungarian nobility. His
performance was so extraordinary that some of those present agreed to
give Liszt a pension for six years to insure his proper education.
Accordingly, father and son went to Vienna, where the boy studied the
piano with Carl Czerny and composition with Salieri. Czerny put Liszt
through so thorough a course of discipline that at eleven years of age
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Liszt was known for his playing from scores, and reading the most
difficult compositions at sight. In 1823, he gave two successful
concerts; Beethoven was present at the second, and publicly kissed the
boy in token of his approval. Liszt’s father now took him to Paris
to study at the Conservatory, but the director, Cherubini, refused
to allow him to enter because he was a foreigner. Liszt studied
composition, however, with Paer and afterwards with Reicha. In the
meantime, letters of introduction from Liszt’s Hungarian patrons soon
sufficed to make him known throughout the most aristocratic circles,
where he created an absolute furore. A public concert produced the same
results on a larger scale. Later, Liszt made two visits to England; he
was received at the Court of George IV, played in private, and gave
concerts. On returning to Paris, he completed an opera, which was
performed in Paris. This opera and other compositions of this period
have entirely disappeared. Tours through France and a third visit to
England followed. In 1827, Liszt’s father died, and his mother came
to Paris to live; he supported her by giving lessons, and was soon in
great demand as a teacher. An unfortunate love-affair caused him to
consider entering the church. He lost interest in music, fell ill,
and was supposed to be dead. Liszt gradually recovered, however.
He now underwent a remarkable series of formative influences; he
read widely, formed the acquaintance of many celebrated personages,
including Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Victor Hugo and George Sand, became
interested in the principles of St. Simonians, a somewhat socialistic
sect, dallied with free-thinking and revolutionary tendencies, formed
a friendship with the Abbé Lamennais, and became intimate with Berlioz and Chopin.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
<b>Period of Preparation</b>.—Of far deeper result was the appearance
of Paganini in Paris during 1831. Liszt bent all his energies towards
devising a transcendent piano technic to reproduce Paganini’s caprices
on the piano. It was at this time that he laid the foundations of his
gigantic achievements in piano technic, not merely in the interest of
virtuosity, but for extending the limits of expression. He was also
much affected by Chopin’s poetic individuality. In 1834, Liszt entered
into an intimacy with the Comtesse d’Agoult, which lasted for several
years. Three children were born of this union, of whom two survived.
One daughter married M. Ollivier, a French statesman, the other became
successively Mme. von Bülow and Mme. Wagner. During this period Liszt
composed much for piano, made many transcriptions, and began his
literary activity on musical subjects. He gave concerts, chiefly for
charity. In 1837, he made a trip to Paris to contest the supremacy of
the piano with Thalberg. Among his compositions of this period may be
mentioned the etudes, the Rossini transcriptions, many arrangements of
Schubert’s songs, the piano scores of several Beethoven symphonies,
besides opera-fantasies, original pieces for piano, etc.</p>
<p><b>Professional Activity</b>.—In 1838, Liszt created an extraordinary
sensation by his concerts in Vienna, and from 1839 to 1847 lived
the life of a traveling virtuoso, giving an unparalleled series of
recitals throughout the length and breadth of Europe, which were a
series of triumphs such as no artist had ever before experienced. In
1832, he was made court music-director at Weimar, his duties only
requiring his presence for three months in the year. In 1847, Liszt
met the Princess von Sayn-Wittgenstein, who exercised a remarkable
influence over him. She persuaded him to give up his career as a
virtuoso, and turn to composition. From 1848 to 1861 Liszt passed the
most significant period of his life at Weimar. From his position as
conductor he was of inestimable service to the cause of romantic music
through his performance of operas and orchestral works by Wagner,
Berlioz, Schumann, Raff, Cornelius and others. He was equally active
with his pen in deference to the new artistic principles. To this epoch
belong Liszt’s most important orchestral works, the concertos and other
compositions for piano and orchestra, many transcriptions and editions of the classics.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Later Life</b>.—In 1859, opposition to Liszt’s progressiveness
became so pronounced that he resigned. He did not leave Weimar,
however, until 1861. The rest of his life was somewhat irregularly
divided between Rome, Weimar and Budapest. During the first few years
at Rome he composed chiefly church music and oratorios; in 1865, he
took minor orders in the Church of Rome. From 1869 on, persuaded by the
Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, he passed portions of every year at
Weimar in a beautiful house especially furnished for him by the Duke.
Pupils flocked to him, he held a sort of musical court, and was treated
with the respect due to royalty. His later years were full of activity,
and generous sympathy to all that was worthy, and he was the constant
object of homage and affection. In 1886, Liszt became overtaxed by a
series of trips to hear his own works performed, including a reception
in his honor at London. He also made exceptional effort to attend a
performance of “Tristan and Isolde” at Bayreuth. A cold was speedily
followed by pneumonia, from which he died on July 31, 1886.</p>
<p><b>Liszt’s Personality and Character</b>.—Liszt’s character was
remarkable for its conspicuous virtues and almost equally prominent
faults. His was a large, noble nature, with deep humanitarian traits.
His life was one long service to his art, accompanied in his later
years by devotion to the church. Though not highly educated, except
in experience of men and the world, he had an extremely keen mind,
omnivorous in its tastes, and his interests were wide and penetrating.
Perhaps his salient characteristics were generosity and unselfishness.
Often during his career as a virtuoso he gave freely of the proceeds
of his concerts to charity. After the close of his concert-tours he
taught for years without remuneration. His help to younger artists
was incalculable in its extent. As conductor at Weimar his motto was
to help living composers first, and by his energy he did valiant work
in helping Wagner’s cause. Largely endowed with wit, a fund of irony
and charm of manner, men and women alike almost literally fell at his
feet, and it is all the more admirable that in spite of the homage so
unsparingly lavished upon him, he did not swerve from his artistic
purposes. The strain of mysticism so marked in his youth, became later
so pronounced that he felt compelled to give it expression by entering the church.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Liszt as a Pianist</b>.—Liszt was the most phenomenal pianist in
the history of music. Other pianists have surpassed him in single
qualities, but no one has united in so stupendous fashion as much
as he. Beginning with a strictly classical education, Liszt evolved
a new technic which completely summed up the difficulties of piano
playing. In velocity, wide stretches, double-notes, octaves, and a
whole system in itself of interlocking passages, he all but attained
the impossible. He carried independence of fingers, especially in fugue
playing, to a pitch hitherto unequalled. His performance of brilliant
music represented the last word in bravura; in the classics his
interpretation was, as Wagner says: “not reproduction, but production,”
so vivid and glowing was it. His so-called “orchestral style” in its
bold color and rich pedal effects was as distinct from the piano
playing before him as the modern orchestra was from that of Mozart
and Haydn. As he assimilated everything in the field of piano playing
before him, so has everything since him been forced to take his method into account.</p>
<p><b>Liszt’s Compositions</b>.—Among Liszt’s chief compositions are the
“Faust” and “Dante” symphonies, with choral epilogues; twelve symphonic
poems, a form which he invented, and which is epoch-making in the
development of music; many shorter orchestral works; two concertos,
the Hungarian fantasy, the “Dance of Death” for piano and orchestra,
besides several compositions for the same combination on themes of
other composers; the oratorios “St. Elizabeth” and “Christus,” a
Solemn Mass, the Hungarian Coronation Mass, several other masses,
twelve sacred hymns for chorus, five psalms, and many other pieces
of church music, choruses for men’s voices, several compositions for
solos, chorus and orchestra for various festival occasions; fifty-five
songs for voice with piano accompaniment; three collections containing
twenty-five pieces for piano, entitled “Years of Pilgrimage,” a
collection of the piano pieces named “Poetic and Religious Harmonies,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>”
twelve “Etudes of Transcendent Technic,” three concert studies, a
sonata, two ballades, two “Legends,” a concert solo, afterwards
arranged as a “Pathetic” concerto, a Valse Impromptu, two polonaises,
six Consolations, a Spanish Rhapsody, and nineteen Hungarian Rhapsodies
are the best known of the piano music. There are five ballades for
declamation with piano accompaniment. For organ, there is a fantasy and
fugue on a choral from Meyerbeer’s “Prophet,” a fugue on B. A. C. H.,
and variations on a theme from a Bach cantata.</p>
<p><b>Liszt’s Arrangements</b>.—Of almost equal importance with Liszt’s
original compositions are his matchless transcriptions. Instead of a
trivial and literal process of transcribing, he penetrated the intimate
spirit of the piece, and translated it into his own piano idiom, often
adding considerably but always with supreme artistic effect. What is
lost in fidelity of transfer is more than gained in added charm, new
harmonic significance and a subtle enhancing of individuality. Liszt
started the evolution of his epoch-making technic while experimenting
with his arrangement of Paganini’s caprices, and of Berlioz’ “Fantastic
Symphony.” He made easy arrangements from operas of Rossini, Mercadante
and Donizetti. Then he turned to setting Schubert’s matchless songs for
the piano, arranging in all fifty-seven; he continued by making piano
scores of Beethoven’s symphonies, of Rossini’s overture to “William
Tell,” and to Weber’s overtures “Jubilee,” “Freischütz” and “Oberon.”
He also made many transcriptions from Wagner’s operas, including “The
Flying Dutchman,” “Tannhäuser,” “Lohengrin,” “Die Meistersinger,”
“Tristan and Isolde” and “Parsifal,” besides a fantasy on themes from
“Rienzi,” and an arrangement of the “Walhalla” motive from “The Ring of
the Nibelungs.” Liszt’s arrangements of six preludes and fugues as well
as the fantasy and fugue in G minor by Bach are not only remarkable for
the extent to which they reproduce organ-effect, but as pioneers in the
transfer of organ pieces to the piano, in which Liszt has been followed
by Tausig, d’Albert and Busoni. In addition he<span class="pagenum">
<a id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> transcribed fourteen
songs by Schumann, thirteen by Franz, eight by Mendelssohn, seven by
Beethoven, six by Chopin and two by Weber, besides an arrangement from
Mendelssohn’s music to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and “piano scores”
of the septets by Beethoven and Hummel. Liszt arranged Weber’s “Polacca
Brillante,” Op. 72, and Schubert’s Fantasy, Op. 15, for piano and
orchestra. There are also many transcriptions of pieces by Palestrina,
Di Lasso, Arcadelt, Mozart, Glinka, Dargomischky, Saint-Saëns, Verdi,
Raff, Gounod, Rubinstein, Tchaikovsky, César Cui and others. Liszt
scored the accompaniment of several Schubert songs for orchestra, he
also orchestrated several of the Schubert four-hand marches. He also
arranged many of his own songs, orchestral and choral works for piano
and for organ. His transcriptions as a whole are monumental not only on
account of their artistic merit, but because they served an educational
purpose in spreading the works of little known composers. In this way
Liszt cultivated the public taste for Schubert’s songs, and brought
Wagner within the reach of the average concert-goer.</p>
<p><b>Liszt as Writer</b>.—As a critic, Liszt must stand as a pioneer
although in a different direction from Schumann. Liszt’s early essay
on the position of the artist is extremely significant; his criticisms
during the Weimar period, especially his analyses of Wagner’s operas
were of great value; his “Life of Chopin,” while untrustworthy in
detail and somewhat overdrawn, is nevertheless graphic; “The Gipsies
and Their Music” is picturesque if not entirely accurate. Liszt’s
letters contain glimpses of his high qualities as well as vital
presentations of his musical views. The correspondence between Wagner
and Liszt gives conclusive evidence of the latter’s unselfishness in
Wagner’s behalf.</p>
<p><b>Liszt’s Position and Influence as a Composer</b>.—Liszt’s rank as
a composer was undoubtedly overshadowed by his fame as a pianist and
teacher, and by his facility as an arranger. For many years neither
critics nor public would acknowledge his creative gifts. Whatever our
opinion of the symphonies, the symphonic poems and the concertos, there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
is no doubt that Liszt rendered an inestimable service to the
development of music in breaking away from the sonata form, and in
demonstrating that form and substance can go hand-in-hand without
detriment to organic unity and coherence. His forms are novel, his
orchestration highly effective in spite of the achievements of Berlioz
and Wagner in this direction. Liszt’s church music and his oratorios
are worthy efforts towards a reform of ecclesiastic music. His songs
are truly spontaneous lyrics, which are not appreciated at their true
value. In spite of Liszt’s unquestioned attainments as a composer,
there is a suggestion of skilful assimilation in his individuality
rather than of unique and unquestioned personality. Nevertheless his
influence has been vast. In his old age he encouraged Borodin and
Glazounoff, he conducted works by Rimsky-Korsakoff, he made his pupils
play Balakireff’s “Islamey.” In turn, the “new-Russian” school owes
much to him. Tchaikovsky could hardly have written his symphonic poems
without Liszt’s pioneer work to show the way. Saint-Saëns admits a
similar influence. In fact, the entire development of the symphonic
poem is directly due to Liszt; it is so considerable in extent that
the details cannot be examined here, but while both Wagner and Berlioz
contributed much to the growth of orchestral style and individuality
of expression, the originality of the symphonic poem form belongs
entirely to Liszt. Thus Liszt’s share in the evolution of ultra-modern
orchestral music, as well as in the development of piano playing, is
very important, and the greatest living composer, Richard Strauss,
although also influenced by both Berlioz and Wagner, frankly avows
himself to be a disciple of Liszt.</p>

<p>What has been Liszt’s share in the development of the “modern school”?</p>
<p>The student who wishes to examine Liszt’s works for himself, should
study the symphonies and symphonic poems in Liszt’s own arrangement for
two pianos. They require, however, a technic beyond the average player.
The same difficulty applies to his piano music, but the following
may serve as guides to Liszt’s style: The “Lake of Wallenstadt,” and
“Eclogue,” Nos. 2 and 7, in the Swiss “Years of Pilgrimage”; the
“Gondoliera” and “Tarantelle” from “Venice and Naples,” the “Valse
Impromptu,” “Ave Maria,” “Waldesrauschen” and “Gnomenreigen,” the
pieces for Lebert and Stark’s Piano School, the Concert Studies in F
minor and D-flat, the Love Dreams, the Consolations, Nos. 1, 2 and 4;
the Legends, the “Benediction of God in the Solitude” and “Love Song”
from “Poetic and Religious Harmonies,” and the Fantasie on “Rigoletto.”
For the more advanced player may be suggested the Etudes, Nos. 3, 4, 5,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
7, 9, 11 and 12; the Mephisto Waltz, the Second Ballad, “Au Bord d’une
Source” from the Swiss “Years of Pilgrimage,” the Second Polonaise, the
“Funerailles” from “Poetic and Religious Harmonies,” the Sonata, the
Hungarian Rhapsodies, Nos. 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, and the Spanish
Rhapsody; the two concertos in E-flat and A, the Hungarian Fantasy,
and the concert piece “The Dance of Death,” the Fantasy on “Don Juan.”
Among the transcriptions, the Schubert songs, “Hark! Hark! the Lark,”
“Du bist die Ruh,” “Frühlingsglaube,” “The Wanderer,” “By the Sea,”
“Meeresstille,” “Barcarolle,” “Trockne Blumen,” “Wohin,” “Ungeduld,”
“Erl-King”; the Mendelssohn song, “On Wings of Song”; the Schumann
songs, “Dedication,” “To the Sunshine,” and “Spring Night”; the Weber
“Slumber Song” may be suggested. Of the Wagner arrangements, “The
Evening Star”, from Tannhäuser, the “Spinning Song,” from “The Flying
Dutchman,” and “Isolde’s Love Death,” are the most characteristic. The
Paganini Studies, Nos. 2, 3 and 5; the waltz from Gounod’s “Faust,” the
Tarantelle after Auber, and the Overture to “Tannhäuser” are among the
best. Of the songs, “Mignon’s Lied” and “Ueber allen Gipfeln,” “Comment
disaient-ils,” “Angiolin dal biondo crin,” “Es muss ein wunderbares
sein,” “Die drei Zigeuner,” and “Der du von dem Himmel bist” and “Die Lorelei” are the best.

<h2>LESSON XLVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Pianists and Teachers Since Liszt. I</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b>.—The achievements of Liszt in developing piano
technic, in enlarging the scope of piano playing through his masterly
transcriptions, in variety and intensity of interpretation, have
brought results that are enormous in extent and far-reaching in their
developments to the generations that have succeeded him. When Liszt
was in the height of his career as a virtuoso, few could master the
difficulties which his epoch-making works presented. Gradually the
secrets of his technic were revealed to the ambitious few; now they are
almost common property. The great concert pianists of today possess
a technic that would have been unique forty years ago. The repertory
which all pianists worthy the name play from memory (a practice
which Liszt initiated) is exceedingly extensive, while the endurance
which they display and the facility with which they reproduce the
masterpieces of piano literature is stupendous.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Pupils of Liszt</span>.</h3>
<p>Liszt was undoubtedly the greatest revealer of the secrets of piano
playing in the 19th century, and his pupils and those who have
assimilated his teachings occupy a large part of the pianistic activity
of today. Among the first of Liszt’s pupils to become famous were
Tausig and von Bülow. <b>Carl Tausig</b>, born in 1841, died in 1871,
was trained by his father, and later studied with Liszt, under whose
guidance he achieved a phenomenal accuracy of technic, and a commanding
power of interpretation. His short life was spent mainly in concert
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
tours. He established a school of music in Berlin for advanced piano
playing. His untimely death cut short a brilliant career. His edition
of Clementi’s <i>Gradus</i> and a collection of finger exercises are
invaluable to teachers and to students. <b>Hans von Bülow</b>, born in
1830, died 1894, was intended for the law, although he studied the
piano as a boy under Friedrich Wieck. In 1850, he became so absorbed in
Wagner’s music that he abandoned all idea of the law. He studied the
piano with Liszt at Weimar, and soon acquired a remarkable technic. He
was never a pianist of the virtuoso type; his strength lay in striving
to reproduce the intention of the composer as faithfully as possible.
His interpretations of Beethoven were especially famous, although he
was progressive in his tastes. In 1876, he made a tour in the United
States, where he did much to advance the cause of new music. As early
as 1865 he conducted performances of Wagner’s operas, and later his
association with orchestras at Meiningen and of the Berlin Philharmonic
Society placed his reputation as a conductor in the front rank. He was
extremely energetic in Wagner’s behalf and did much to bring his works
to a public hearing. His editions of Cramer’s studies and Beethoven’s
sonatas are of great value.</p>
<p>Among Liszt’s later pupils, one of the foremost is <b>Eugen
D’Albert</b>, born in 1864. He received his early training in England,
but in 1881, as a prize scholar, he studied with Liszt at Weimar. After
brilliant concert tours through Europe, he came to America, in 1889,
with Sarasate, where his ability was at once recognized. He has since
largely renounced the career of virtuoso for that of composer, although
he made a visit to the United States in 1905, giving a number of recitals.</p>
<p><b>Moritz Rosenthal</b>, possibly the most fully equipped virtuoso
technically now before the public, was born in 1862. At first a
pupil of Mikuli, a disciple of Chopin, and later of Joseffy, he came
ultimately to Liszt, with whom he studied for ten years. After numerous
European tours he came to the United States in 1888, where he dazzled
his audiences by his unusual command of technic. He reappeared in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
America in 1896-97, and has since made triumphal progress through
Europe. As an interpreter he is less successful than as a virtuoso.
He is court pianist of Roumania. He has published a collection of
technical exercises with Ludwig Schytté.</p>
<p><b>Bernhard Stavenhagen</b>, born in 1862, is another noted Liszt
pupil. He acted as Liszt’s secretary during his later years, and at the
same time received lessons. In 1890, he became court pianist at Weimar.
In 1894-95, he visited America. Since then he has acted as conductor at
Dresden and Munich.</p>
<p><b>Emil Sauer</b>, another phenomenal pupil of Liszt, was born in 1862.
At first a pupil of Nicholas Rubinstein, he studied with Liszt from
1884 until the latter’s death. He possesses an extraordinary technic,
and is almost unrivalled for the extreme brilliancy of his effects.
He has received many decorations from various courts of Europe. In
1897-98, he visited the United States, where he made a sensation. Since
1901, he has been at the head of the piano department in the Vienna
Conservatory, giving his attention to pupils in the artist department.</p>
<p>Among other talented pupils of Liszt may be mentioned Alfred
Reisenauer, Arthur Friedheim and Richard Burmeister, all of whom have
been heard in this country. The foregoing account does not begin to
enumerate all, merely the celebrated pupils of Liszt. Others will be
referred to in the course of this and the next lesson.</p>
<p><b>Belgian Pianists</b>.—In piano playing, the Brussels Conservatory
is far below the level of the Paris Conservatory, although the
director <b>Gevaërt</b> has a world-wide reputation for his text-book
on orchestration, and the symphony concerts at the conservatory, led
by him, have a high place in orchestral standards. Nevertheless, in
the piano department two names deserve mention: Brassin and Dupont.
<b>Louis Brassin</b> (1840-1884) studied at the Leipzig Conservatory
under Moscheles, where he remained five years, winning numerous prizes.
In 1866, he became first piano teacher at the Stern Conservatory in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Berlin. Later he joined the Brussels Conservatory, as professor of
piano playing, where he taught from 1869-1878. In 1879, he accepted a
position at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he remained until
his death, in 1884. Brassin was not only known as a fine pianist
and teacher, but also by his transcriptions from “The Ring of the
Nibelung.” He also composed piano pieces and even two operettas.
<b>Auguste Dupont</b> (1828-1890) studied at the Liége Conservatory.
After several years of wandering life, he became professor of piano at
the Brussels Conservatory, a position which he held until his death,
in 1890. He is known also as a composer of graceful piano pieces, a
concerto and a concert-piece, in all of which the influence of Schumann is seen.</p>
<p><b>Johannes Brahms</b> (1833-1897), famed both as composer and pianist,
was the son of an orchestral musician in Hamburg, whose circumstances
were of the humblest. As a child he developed remarkable ability as a
pianist, but his first lessons in composition awakened an enthusiasm
that absorbed his entire being. He was comparatively unknown when at
the age of twenty Schumann brought him into public notice by hailing
him as the successor of Beethoven.</p>
<p class="space-below2">Unlike most composers, Brahms was mature
from the very beginning. His early works bear no trace of the
uncertainty and imitation generally associated with youth, and it
was this remarkable maturity that interested Schumann and gave point
to his predictions for the future of the young musician. Unaffected
by the pomp and glow of the ultra-romantic tendency initiated by
Berlioz and culminating at present in the works of Richard Strauss,
he remained true to the great classical school which rests on Bach
and Palestrina. Unlike the modern impressionistic school, his art is
based on essentially musical ideas and their contrapuntal treatment;
it is architectural rather than pictorial. In such a scheme, color
is subordinate to thematic interest, hence his instrumentation often
appears heavy and austere to those who look for the brilliancy and tone
painting of Liszt or Wagner. His music in general is founded on Bach and Beethoven.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="503" src="images/image440.jpg" width="400" id="img_images_image440.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Johannes Brahms</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p>His works for the piano are large and orchestral in style, and demand
a technic of their own, which was at first considered unsuited to the
nature of the instrument. Von Bülow remarks that while in Bach we hear
the organ, in Beethoven the orchestra, in Brahms we hear both organ and
orchestra. Notwithstanding their dignity and nobility of conception,
they won their way but slowly to favor. Their newness of style and
difficulty of execution estranged both public and musicians. Though
Brahms’ four symphonies have become reasonably familiar, his piano
works have not even yet achieved widespread popularity. They comprise
two concertos, three sonatas, many variations, and a host of smaller
pieces—ballades, scherzos, intermezzos, capriccios, etc. Brahms never
wrote for the stage but was active in all other departments of music.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
His greatest choral work is the “German Requiem,” composed in memory
of his mother, to texts selected by himself from the Scriptures and
sung in German, instead of in Latin, hence its name. He drew no little
inspiration from the Folk-song, which he uses not only in the form
of harmonies and rhythms distinctly based on Folk melodies, but in
literal quotations serving as themes in several of his instrumental
compositions. This contact with the people through their songs gives
particular freshness and vigor to much of Brahms’ music, as well as a
sturdy Teutonic character that stamps it as distinctively national in spirit.</p>
<p>It is perhaps too soon to deliver an authoritative judgment as to the
ultimate rank that Brahms will take among the great composers of the
past. There is no doubt, however, that he is one of the commanding
figures of the last century and that he has enriched the world with
a mass of noble music, all of which deserves to be known for its
elevation and consummate mastery of detail.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Russian Pianists</span>.</h3>
<p>Of a somewhat independent development from Liszt, although much
influenced by his personality and his method, was <b>Anton
Rubinstein</b>, born in 1829, died in 1894. He studied the piano at
Moscow with Villoing, who gave him so thorough a training that he had
no other teacher. From 1840, after concerts in Paris, he had universal
recognition as a pianist. Further European tours increased his fame.
He lived successively in Berlin and Vienna, and later returned to St.
Petersburg. In 1872-73, he made a remarkable tour through America,
arousing an enthusiasm only equalled in later years by Paderewski.
Although he passed most of his life in constant activity as a composer,
he directed the Russian Symphony Concerts in St. Petersburg. As
early as 1862 he founded the St. Petersburg Conservatory, which has
had a prominent place in Russian music. He was a complete master
of the piano, his technic was gigantic, although his vitality of
interpretation was so intense that details paled before it. His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
historical recitals covering the entire literature of the piano were
his most conspicuous achievements as a pianist. He may be regarded as
second only to Liszt, and in some respects he even surpassed him. He
was disappointed at not being accorded high rank as a composer, as well
as a pianist.</p>
<p>His brother, <b>Nicholas Rubinstein</b>, born in 1835, died in 1881,
although not so distinguished a pianist, and a composer of slight
account, exerted almost as strong an influence on Russian music. A
pupil of Kullak, he founded the Russian Musical Society at Moscow, in
1859, and in 1864 the Moscow Conservatory, which has been exceedingly
active in Russian musical affairs. He directed the Moscow Conservatory
until his death; he was an intimate adviser of Tchaikovsky, while his
worth as a teacher may be guessed from the prominence of his pupils,
Karl Klindworth, Emil Sauer and Alexander Siloti, possibly the foremost
Russian pianist today.</p>
<p><b>Mili Balakireff</b>, born in 1836, has been a considerable force
in Russian music, besides being a capable pianist. After studying
physics and mathematics at the University of Kazan, he turned to music.
In 1862, he founded a Free School of Music in St. Petersburg. Among
his associates were César Cui, Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakoff, Alexander
Borodine and others. He has done much to aid the Neo-Russian school
of composition. His piano music is effective and highly colored,
especially his fantasy on Georgian themes, “Islamey.”</p>
<p><b>Alexander Siloti</b>, undoubtedly the most widely-known of Russian
pianists, born at Charcow, 1863, was a pupil in piano playing of
Nicholas Rubinstein, at the Moscow Conservatory. From 1883-1886, he
studied with Liszt. His technic is enormous; while not intensely
magnetic, his intellectual grasp of music is remarkable. He made an
American tour in 1898, when he introduced much Russian piano music that
was new. Although Siloti has taught at the Moscow Conservatory, he has
lived of late years at Leipzig and Paris.</p>
<p>Among other Russian pianists are <b>Vassili Sapellnikoff</b>, born
1868, a pupil of Kessler, Louis Brassin, Sophie Menter;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span> <b>Vassili
Safonoff</b>, a pupil of Leschetizky and Zaremba in St. Petersburg,
since 1887 director of the Moscow Conservatory, and more lately a
conductor; <b>Sergei Rachmaninoff</b>, born 1873, a pupil of Siloti,
not only a brilliant pianist but also a composer of originality;
<b>Alexander Scriabine</b>, born 1872, a pupil of Safonoff, who has
made successful European tours, and like Rachmaninoff, has composed
much for his instrument.</p>
<p>Two German pianists, Henselt and Klindworth, were so associated with
Russian music as to warrant their mention here. <b>Adolph Henselt</b>,
born 1814, died 1889, at one time a pupil of Hummel, was for the most
part self-taught. He passed most of his life in St. Petersburg, giving
lessons and playing frequently in public. He also had an official
position as music inspector. As a pianist, Henselt was exceedingly
eminent, and may be ranked next to Rubinstein and von Bülow, although
in later years nervousness prevented his playing in public. His etudes
are distinct additions to the technical resources of the piano, his
arrangements of Cramer etudes with second piano accompaniment are praiseworthy.</p>
<p><b>Karl Klindworth</b>, born 1830, was a pupil of Nicholas Rubinstein
and later, of Liszt. After living in London, he became professor of
piano playing at the Moscow Conservatory, from 1868-1884. Later he
settled in Berlin, became conductor of the Philharmonic Society, and
opened a conservatory with von Bülow, which was merged with that of
Scharwenka in 1893. Klindworth’s edition of Chopin is in some respects
the best. He has also edited Beethoven’s sonatas, and he prepared the
piano score of the entire “Ring of the Nibelung.”</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">French Pianists</span>.</h3>
<p>In presenting the famous French pianists, <b>Charles Henri Valentine
Alkan</b>, born 1813, died 1888, must not be forgotten. A brilliant
pianist, he claims our attention chiefly on account of his etudes,
introducing novel and extremely difficult problems of technic.
Musically his studies cannot be compared with those of Chopin or Liszt,
but they merit attention, particularly in the modern editions.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>
<p>Although <b>Camille Saint-Saëns</b> is known chiefly as a composer, he
was, during his early years, a remarkable pianist. His contributions to
piano literature, five concertos, etudes and smaller pieces, are all valuable.</p>
<p>A group of Paris Conservatory professors constitute the most
distinguishing teaching talent in France today. Further than that,
Paris is one of the great centres of piano playing in Europe. Its
teachers follow their own traditions, yet have assimilated from Liszt.</p>
<p>The oldest of these is <b>Georges Mathias</b> (b. 1826), pupil of
Chopin, Kalkbrenner and the Paris Conservatory, who has been professor
of piano playing since 1862. <b>E. Delaborde</b>, a pupil of Alkan,
Moscheles and Liszt, has taught at the Paris Conservatory since 1873.
One of the most successful teachers now living is <b>Louis Dièmer</b>,
born 1843, a pupil of Marmontel. Winning the first piano prize at the
age of thirteen, he succeeded his former teacher in 1888. Dièmer has
turned out many first prizes; he has an impeccable technic; he has
done much to foster interest in the harpsichord, the oboe d’amore and
other obsolete instruments. He has published valuable collections of
old French harpsichord music, besides original works. A Conservatory
teacher well-known in America is <b>Raoul Pugno</b>, born 1852. A pupil
of the Paris Conservatory, he obtained first prizes in piano playing,
organ and harmony. He came to America in 1897-98 with Ysaye and others,
and again in 1902. He has taught at the Paris Conservatory since
1897. He has a superb technic, and is versatile as an interpreter. He
has also composed much. A teacher of unusual insight into technic is
<b>Isidor Philipp</b>, born 1863, a pupil of Mathias, Saint-Saëns and
others. He possesses a flawlessly accurate technic, and has appeared
frequently in public, although he devotes the greater part of his
energy to teaching. He has published many valuable sets of exercises,
collections of difficult passages, some transcriptions and original
pieces. He has been professor at the Conservatory since 1904.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Louis Breitner</b>, a pupil of the Milan Conservatory, Anton
Rubinstein and Liszt, has lived for many years at Paris as pianist and
teacher. He also has visited America. Among the younger French pianists
are <b>Leon Delafosse</b>, <b>Edouard Risler</b>, an eclectic pianist,
a pupil of Dièmer, D’Albert and Stavenhagen.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLVIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Pianists and Teachers Since Liszt. II</span></span>.</h2>
<p>One of the greatest living teachers in authority and breadth of
influence is <b>Theodor Leschetizky</b>, born in 1831. A pupil of
Czerny, he began to teach at the age of fifteen, having played
in public since 1842. He became a teacher in the St. Petersburg
Conservatory, where he taught for many years. Soon after 1880 he
settled in Vienna, where he has lived ever since. Since the success
of his pupil Paderewski, Leschetizky has been the most sought-after
teacher in the world. He has been obliged to have assistants to prepare
pupils for him. Students have come to Vienna from all parts of the
world. A brilliant pianist, he has written piano music and even an
opera, but his merit as a teacher is due to the foundation given him
by Czerny, who acquired his traditions from Beethoven, to the keenness
of his ability to prescribe for the individual needs of the pupil and
the simplicity and directness of his “method.” His pupils have met with
great success, although he has not yet produced a second Paderewski.</p>
<p><b>Ignaz Paderewski</b>, probably the greatest pianist since Liszt,
although like him excelled in some respects by others, was born in
1859. A pupil of the Warsaw Conservatory, he also studied at Berlin.
He taught piano at the Warsaw Conservatory from 1878-83, and also at
Strassburg. Later he went to Leschetizky for a thorough course of
study. After his début at Vienna, in 1887, he conquered by degrees
Paris and London. His first visit to America was in 1891, when he
carried all before him. Since then he has visited the United States
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
three times, he has traveled over all Europe, and has visited Australia
with overwhelming success, financial and artistic. His most noticeable
qualities are a magnetic personality, a virtuoso technic, the color and
piquant rhythm of his playing, and the poetry and deep human intensity
of his interpretations. He has written several sets of pieces for
the piano, a concerto, and a fantasy with orchestra, and an opera.
His generous gift of the endowment of triennial prizes to American
composers is an admirable instance of his warm-heartedness.</p>
<p><b>Josef Slavinski</b>, born 1865, who studied with Stroeble, Anton
Rubinstein and finally Leschetizky, is a pianist of great ability who
came to the United States in 1873, and again in 1901. Other Leschetizky
pupils are <b>Ossip Gabrilowitsch</b>, born 1878, also a pupil of Anton
Rubinstein and the St. Petersburg Conservatory, who came to America in
1900 and 1902; <b>Mark Hambourg</b>, born in 1879, who first studied
with his father, and after a tour of the United States in 1900, has had
brilliant successes in Europe and England; <b>Martinus Sieveking</b>,
born 1867, a pupil of Röntgen at Leipzig, who visited America in 1895
and again in 1896-97 and afterwards went to Vienna. There are many
other brilliant pupils of Leschetizky, but the foregoing are some of
the best known.</p>
<p>Paderewski has not taught, as a rule, since his great triumphs as a
virtuoso, but he has made exceptions. <b>Sigismond Stojowski</b>, born
1870, was a pupil of the Paris Conservatory, where he won first prizes
in piano playing and composition. Later he studied with Paderewski, and
lived as pianist, teacher and composer in Paris. In 1905, he accepted
the position of head of the piano department at the Institute of
Musical Art, New York City. <b>Antoinette Szumowska-Adamowska</b> was
born in 1868. She studied at Warsaw, and later, for several years, with
Paderewski. She has made successful appearances in Europe and America.
Later she accepted a position at the New England Conservatory, in Boston, U. S. A.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>
<p>Another pianist of great ability who has profited by Paderewski’s
suggestions is <b>Harold Bauer</b>, born in 1873. A student of the
violin, as well as of the piano, he did not consider making a career
as a piano virtuoso until encouraged by Paderewski. In 1892, he
studied with Paderewski, although he is largely self-taught, for his
individuality and musical style show slight effects of Paderewski’s
influence. Bauer’s technic is superb, although he is not a virtuoso
pure and simple. His interpretations are healthy and vigorous, and
especially faithful to the composers’ intentions. His repertory is
enormous. He has made several extremely successful tours to the United
States. He has traveled also widely in Europe as well as to South
America. Bauer is one of the most eminent of living artists.</p>
<p>Among Norwegians, <b>Edvard Grieg</b>, born 1843, is a remarkable
interpreter of his own individual works. <b>Christian Sinding</b> and
<b>Wilhelm Stenhammar</b> also deserve mention.</p>
<p>The Italians have not produced many remarkable pianists, nevertheless,
several are well known. Chief among them is <b>Giovanni Sgambati</b>,
born 1843, a pupil of Liszt. Sgambati has composed charming music
for the piano, as well as chamber-music, a concerto and symphony.
He is director of the Academy of St. Cecilia, at Rome. <b>Giuseppe
Buonamici</b>, born 1846, a pupil of the Munich Conservatory and
of von Bülow, has done much to promote music in Florence. He has
been connected with several musical societies in that city, and has
been active as a teacher. His editions of Beethoven’s sonatas, of
Bertini’s etudes, and a treatise on scale playing are of great value
to the student. The most prominent Italian pianist, who has lived a
cosmopolitan life, is <b>Feruccio Busoni</b>, born in 1866. Early in
life he became a member, as a pianist, of the Bologna Philharmonic
Academy, after a severe test. In 1888, he accepted a position at
the Helsingfors Conservatory. In 1890, he won the Rubinstein prize
as composer and pianist. Subsequently he taught the piano in the
Moscow Conservatory, and later he was connected with the New England
Conservatory at Boston. Since then he has lived in Europe as a pianist
and conductor of ultra-modern music. Busoni has one of the most
formidable technics of any pianist living. He has edited Bach’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
“Well-Tempered Clavichord,” with many helpful technical suggestions,
also the smaller preludes and inventions; he has made masterly
transcriptions of Bach’s organ works for the piano, of a fantasy
for organ by Liszt, the same composer’s “Mephisto Waltz,” etc. He
re-visited America in 1904.</p>
<p><b>Stephen Heller</b>, born 1814, died 1888, was much influenced by
Chopin. He was a talented pianist, who will be remembered chiefly by
his studies, and a few other pieces, which have decided educational value.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>
<p>Among other living pianists who escape classification for one reason
or another are <b>Moritz Moszkowski</b>, born 1854, a pupil of the
Dresden, Kullak and Stern Conservatories; while a successful pianist
and teacher, he is known chiefly for his fluent and graceful piano
music, although he has composed works in larger forms. <b>Franz
Rummel</b>, born 1853, died 1901, a pupil of Brassin and the Brussels
Conservatory, toured Europe and visited America several times; he
taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin; <b>Rafael Joseffy</b>,
born 1853, went to the Leipzig Conservatory, he then studied with
Carl Tausig and later with Liszt; of late years he has taught at
the National Conservatory at New York. His concert appearances have
invariably been successful, although he has devoted himself largely
to teaching. A pianist of especial distinction is <b>Vladimir de
Pachmann</b>, born in 1848, a pupil of the Vienna Conservatory; in
spite of a brilliant début he retired for many years’ study; on
reappearing he gave concerts over all Europe, and has made several
visits to America; his chief triumphs have been as the inimitable
interpreter of Chopin; <b>Leopold Godowsky</b>, born 1870, appeared
as a prodigy at the age of nine; he studied at the <i>Hochschule</i> in
Berlin, made European tours, and studied with Saint-Saëns from 1887 to
1890; he taught at conservatories in Philadelphia and Chicago; in 1902,
he returned to Europe, where he has given concerts constantly with
phenomenal success. A composer of piano pieces, he has devised many
extraordinary versions of Chopin’s studies.</p>
<p>Among English pianists, <b>Frederic Lamond</b>, a pupil of the Raff
Conservatory, of von Bülow and Liszt, and <b>Leonard Borwick</b>, a
pupil of Mme. Schumann, are the best known, although there are many
pianists of rising reputation.</p>
<p>Two young pianists deserving of especial recognition are Ernst von
Dohnanyi and Josef Hofmann. <b>Dohnanyi</b>, born 1877, is a pupil of
Kessler and D’Albert. In 1898, he won a double success as pianist and
composer with a piano concerto. In 1900, he made a brilliant tour in
America. Since then he has devoted himself largely to composition.
<b>Josef Hofmann</b> was a pupil of his father, and later, of Anton
Rubinstein. He played the piano when six years old; in public at the
age of nine. In the following year he gave fifty-two concerts in the
United States. After retiring for study under Rubinstein, he reappeared
a mature artist. He has since visited America several times. Hofmann
has an unusual technic; his individuality is not striking, but he is an
artist of conspicuous merit.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">American Pianists</span>.</h3>
<p>The rapid progress of music in America renders it impossible to do
justice to piano playing in this country. However, the pioneer work
of <b>William Mason</b>, a pupil of Moscheles, Dreyschock and Liszt,
active as pianist and teacher, the author of “Touch and Technic” and
other technical treatises; of B. J. Lang, a pupil of his father, F.
C. Hill, Salter and Alfred Jaell, an active pianist, teacher, and
conductor, of W. S. B. Mathews, Otto Dresel, Ernst Perabo, and others,
was of great importance. Later <b>Carl Baermann</b>, a Liszt pupil,
Carl Faelten, <b>William Sherwood</b>, also a Liszt pupil, Carl Stasny,
Arthur Whiting, Edward MacDowell and many others have continued the
work so ably begun. <b>Edward MacDowell</b> is easily the most noted
American composer-pianist. His technical equipment, personality, and
interpretative gifts justly entitle him to this distinction. A pupil of
Mme. Carreño, Marmontel and Carl Heymann, he has had thorough training.
His pianistic career has been limited by his efforts as a composer, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
by his work as Professor of Music at Columbia, which position he
resigned in 1904, as well as his activity as a teacher. His studies,
concertos and smaller pieces show great individuality of technical
style, besides being among the most valuable contributions to piano
literature since Liszt. MacDowell has appeared with leading orchestras
in this country; he has given many recitals, including a tour of the
United States in 1904.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Women Pianists</span>.</h3>
<p>Of the many distinguished women pianists since Liszt, the most eminent
was <b>Mme. Clara Schumann</b>, a pupil of her father, Friedrich
Wieck. She played in public from the age of thirteen, winning instant
recognition. Her marriage to Schumann diminished her public activity,
but after his death in 1856, she resumed her career. She taught at the
Hoch Conservatory at Frankfort, besides playing in public in Europe and
England. Among other famous women pianists were Madame Clauss-Szavardy,
<b>Mme. Arabella Goddard Davidson</b>, and Mme. Sophie Menter. <b>Mme.
Teresa Carreño</b>, a pupil of L. M. Gottschalk and G. Mathias, has
had a remarkable career as concert-pianist. <b>Mme. Essipoff</b>, a
pupil of Wielhorski and Leschetizky, taught for many years at the St.
Petersburg Conservatory, after brilliant concert tours. Miss Fanny
Davies, a pupil of Reinecke and Mme. Schumann, Mme. Roger-Miclos and
Mlle. Clotilde Kleeberg, pupils of the Paris Conservatory, are all
pianists of distinction. In this country Miss Adele aus der Ohe, a
pupil of Kullak and Liszt, <b>Mme. Bloomfield-Zeisler</b>, a pupil of
von Wolfssohn and Leschetizky, and <b>Mme. Helen Hopekirk</b>, a pupil
of the Leipzig Conservatory and of Leschetizky, now a teacher at the
New England Conservatory, and <b>Mme. Szumowska-Adamowska</b>, before
mentioned as a pupil of Paderewski, are all pianists of great ability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may be stated that while Liszt’s pupils have done
much to carry on the traditions which he originated, much has also been
accomplished for the advancement of pianistic art by Leschetizky and
his pupils, a remarkable group of teachers at the Paris Conservatory,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
and by such independent pianists as de Pachmann, Busoni, Siloti,
Godowsky, Bauer and Hofmann, while many able conservatories and private
teachers in America are enabling the American pianist to compete
favorably with Europe.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Art-Song. Oratorio after Mendelssohn</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Development of the Art-Song Idea</b>.—A most significant phase of
musical activity is that centred around the art-song for solo voice. In
the period before the opera, choral singing was the principal medium
for vocal music. With the Opera came a style of composition from
which was developed the principle of the Aria, the latter dominating
both Opera and Oratorio for many years, as the form for an art-song
for a solo voice. In this form, as we have seen, the production of
vocal effects, the making of attractive melody, and the opportunity
for virtuosic display were sought first of all. It was not until the
beginning of the 19th century, when Schubert’s peculiar genius asserted
itself, that we meet what can be truly called the art-song, a form of
composition without the artificiality of the operatic aria and with
higher musicianly and artistic qualities than those that mark the
people’s song. Several tendencies contributed to bring this about.
Gluck’s theories and practice led both composers and people to pay
closer attention to the text and to its delivery. The development of
instrumental music, particularly the principles of thematic treatment,
led composers to the inventing of new melodic and rhythmic figures that
should serve as the basis of accompaniments of higher artistic quality
than those founded on some variation of the Alberti bass figure. Piano
technic had greatly improved, and so had the instrument. And it may
also be said that the verse of this period was better suited for a
dramatic musical setting than the formal, often stilted and artificial
lyrics of earlier days, with their shepherds and shepherdesses and
constant reference to pastoral and classical life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Italian, French and English Forms</b>.—A study of musical
conditions in Italy, France, Germany and England shows a different
style of the solo song in each country, each having some distinctive
feature that maintains today, and one that may be said to characterize
the song-idea of that people. The Italians were so taken with the opera
and in the course of its development it so fully embodied the national
love for sweet, graceful melody that a species of art-song apart
from the opera had little or no chance to shape itself. The French
<i>Chanson</i> has never yielded place to the methods which distinguish
the modern art-song. The French language has certain qualities which
seem to call for a treatment that centres the attention in the voice
part rather than on the song as a whole, according to the German idea.
Yet French composers have produced and still make most beautiful and
charming songs which unmistakably embody the national characteristics,
clearness, polish and an effective singing melody. The old English
Ballads are pieces of narrative verse; but the term has been used so
freely and for almost every kind of verse that it is not possible to
give it a precise definition. Thomas Morley, in a work on music, which
he published in 1597, mentions “songs which, being sung to a dittie
may likewise be danced”; in 1636, in a book called “The Principles of
Musicke,” the author, Butler, refers to “the infinite multitude of
Ballads set to sundry pleasant and delightful tunes by cunning and
witty composers, with country dances fitted to them.” The principles of
musical construction and the character of the text are such that we do
not find in the English ballad the true germ of the art-song.</p>
<p><b>The German “Lied”</b>, a poem intended for singing, as it came from
the hands of the great poets, such as Goethe and Heine, seems to have
afforded to composers the inspiration to the making of a style of song
that should have the value of a musical setting in full consonance
with the character of the text. As instrumental music developed, the
<i>Volkslied</i>, the people’s song, the natural medium for expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
gradually disappeared. Yet composers made use of it as a medium, such
masters as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Weber giving attention to it,
although the demand for a simple, clear melody, due to the dominance
of the Italian opera, and for an accompaniment that was always much
subordinated, prevented the art-song (<i>Kunstlied</i>) from taking a high
place. Since then the accompaniment has been given more and more
prominence, less attention being paid to pure melody and more to the
value of harmony and rhythm as the means for characteristic color and
expression. Melody, which is made up of a succession of phrases, cannot
furnish a sequence of sharp effects so readily as can well contrasted
chords; hence the old idea of tune changed as harmony became better
understood. The methods of song composers vary, and a classification
is made by German writers: A song that has simple form and tune akin
to that of the Folk-song is called “<i>Volksthümlich</i>”; one that has the
same tune to the different stanzas is called strophic; one that is
carefully worked out, the music illustrating every shade of meaning
and emotion is called “<i>Durchcomponirt</i>”; a narrative song is called
a “Ballad” or “Ballade.” The great masters in song composition are
Schubert, Schumann, Franz and Brahms.</p>
<p><b>Schubert as a Song Writer</b>.—A consideration of Schubert’s
education and his general make-up shows clearly why he should
seek outlet for self-expression in song rather than in the large
instrumental forms. We find that he was not systematically educated in
musical science, like Mozart, Beethoven or Weber, and that he was by
nature very spontaneous and amenable to external influences. Such a
composer is particularly open to the effect of a poem and will turn to
the small song form rather than to the elaborate instrumental forms.
Many of Schubert’s songs were written on the spur of the moment in
response to an impulse from reading a chance bit of verse. The first
reading of the poem usually gave the complete idea, both tune and
accompaniment; whether it should have the simple folk-song character, a
more declamatory style, strophic or the more elaborate form, depended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
upon the character of the text. It is fortunate for music that he was
brought into contact with some of the finest lyrics in the field of
poetry, such as called forth his highest powers in melody, harmony,
rhythm, modulation, declamation and recitative, for he aimed to the
very fullest extent possible to heighten the thought of the text by the
emotional power of music. It is a phase of Schubert’s genius that some
of his finest songs were written before he had reached his majority.</p>
<p><b>Schumann and His Songs</b>.—Schumann brought to song writing a
different type of mind from that of Schubert, more poetic, more gloomy,
more emotional, a fine literary training, a faculty for expression
in word as well as in tone, a fund of new forms of expression in
instrumental music, particularly the piano, so that we find in his
songs certain elements that indicate development toward a more highly
organized structure. Schumann was highly intellectual, hence we find in
his songs a close union of voice and instrumental parts in working out
the fundamental conception of the poet’s meaning; and so deeply does
he carry out this plan that the accompanist must enter most thoroughly
into the singer’s part, and <i>vice versa</i>, that the full effect be
brought out; as compared with the songs of Schubert and Mendelssohn we
can say that the latter are the “verses set to tunes, while Schumann’s
songs are poems in music.” The piano part of a Schumann song contains
the atmosphere of the poem, is an attempt to heighten the meaning by
suggesting thoughts and feelings which the words, spoken or sung,
cannot express; sometimes it is an entirely independent composition,
and carries out to a final close the thought left unfinished by the
voice, thus avoiding the conventional ending, by the singer, on the
tonic chord. Schumann’s effort was to express his own reading of the
poet’s lines by the musical means that seemed to him best suited to
the purpose. To this end he refused to allow himself to be bound by
conventional treatment, either of voice or instrument.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Robert Franz</b> (1815-1892) combined in his songs the romanticism
and general methods of Schumann, with a polyphonic treatment inspired
by his deep study of Bach. He wrote to various styles of verse, hymns,
love-songs, lyrics of the field, the forest, the hunter, the soldier,
and though his songs lack the tender, passionate, melodious quality
of Schubert’s and the deep poetic feeling of Schumann’s, they are
nevertheless models of perfect, even elaborate workmanship in which
the composer follows with great faithfulness the mood of the poet;
Schumann, on the contrary, seems to project his own interpretation of
the poem into his music, while Schubert seems to grasp the emotion at
its highest moment and the song pours out as the spontaneous expression
of the singer.</p>
<p><b>Three Modern Writers</b>.—Of modern writers, those who contributed
most to the development of the art-song are Wagner, Brahms and Richard
Strauss, the first-named by his style and treatment of the voice
and the instrumental part rather than by his songs, which are few
in number. <b>Brahms</b> wrote nearly two hundred songs, varying in
character and quality, and using a highly-developed accompaniment,
often intricate in its construction, complicated in rhythm and restless
in harmonic support, employing all the resources which his mastery
of chromatic harmony placed at his disposal. He frequently wrote in
the style of the Folk-song, making use of its simple melodic quality,
enriching it, however, by his great skill in elaboration in the
accompaniment. Brahms’ songs are great favorites on concert programs.
<b>Richard Strauss</b> (b. 1864) is the leading composer of today, and
has used in his songs the principles that distinguish his large works.
These songs are very difficult, both for voice and accompaniment, and
are full of tonal coloring, for Strauss has adapted to the miniature
form of the song the means of harmonic and rhythmic effects which he
uses so powerfully in his orchestral scores. When well sung and well
played, the hearer cannot but be absorbed by the wealth of musical
effects of the highest emotional and picturesque quality displayed in
Richard Strauss’ songs. In a full study of songs and song writers, many
more names would be mentioned; those selected for consideration in this
lesson represent those who have contributed most significantly to the
development of the modern art-song.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Oratorio Composers after Mendelssohn</b>.—The later history of the
Oratorio requires some consideration at this point. After Mendelssohn,
many of the leading composers of Europe turned their attention to
this form of composition, influenced, in many instances, by the
splendid opportunities for production offered by the strong choral
organizations and festival associations of Germany and England, as
well as by the great advances made in orchestral playing, which gave
to composers resources far beyond those at the hand of Mendelssohn and
his predecessors. We may mention, among the Germans, <b>Schumann</b>,
whose “Paradise and the Peri” was produced in 1843; <b>Liszt</b>, who
was much attracted to sacred subjects, wrote two oratorios, “The Legend
of St. Elizabeth” and “Christus”; <b>Rubinstein</b>, who used his
great skill in tone painting with orchestral masses in “Paradise Lost”
and in his sacred opera “The Tower of Babel”; <b>Brahms</b>, whose
“German Requiem” is a standard work to be done well only by thoroughly
disciplined vocal and instrumental forces; and <b>Dvořák</b>, who has
shown great power in his “Stabat Mater.” Among the French writers
most prominent in this form of composition are <b>Berlioz</b>, whose
“Requiem” is a colossal work in which he drew upon all the resources
of the orchestra to heighten the powerful, dramatic character of the
text; <b>Gounod</b>, who wrote his remarkable works, “The Redemption”
and “Mors et Vita” for English production; <b>Saint-Saëns</b>, whose
“Noël,” a Christmas work, is oratorio in style and construction,
although small in dimensions; and <b>César Franck</b>, the most
modern of all, whose “Beatitudes” has been made the subject of much
discussion. English composers, following the lead of Handel and
Mendelssohn, have given great attention to this form. <b>Bennett</b>,
the friend of Mendelssohn, produced a beautiful work, “The Woman of
Samaria”; <b>Costa</b>, an Italian by birth, spent a great part of his
professional life in England; hence his oratorio, “Eli,” may be classed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
with English works; <b>Sullivan</b> wrote two oratorios, “The Prodigal
Son” and “The Light of the World”; <b>Macfarren’s</b> “St. John the
Baptist” and <b>Mackenzie’s</b> “Rose of Sharon” can be classed
among oratorios. The most eminent in this form at the present day is
<b>Elgar</b>, “The Dream of Gerontius” and “The Apostles.” Young Italy
has lately shown interest in this form, the most noteworthy being the
<b>Abbé Perosi</b>, who is under the patronage of the Pope. In the
United States the leading representatives are <b>J. K. Paine</b>, of
Harvard University, with the oratorio “St. Peter,” <b>Dudley Buck</b>,
“Golden Legend,” and <b>H. W. Parker</b>, “Hora Novissima.”</p>
<p><b>The Cantata</b>.—More popular even than the Oratorio with choral
societies is the Cantata, both sacred and secular, and the great
increase in strong choral organizations, particularly in England,
Germany, France and the United States, has resulted in the production
of a number of splendid works which show dramatic power and the
highest skill in handling voices and instruments. These works contain
opportunities for the use of the finest quality of melody, variety of
rhythm, solid harmonic or the more fluent polyphonic style, richness
of harmonic coloring and every accessory in the way of tone painting
by the orchestra, which such masters as Berlioz and Wagner pointed
out. The important works are too many to be mentioned here; only the
composers’ names can be given. In Germany, Brahms, Bruch, Dvořák, Gade,
Goetz, Hiller, Hofmann, Rheinberger; in France, Berlioz and Massenet;
in England, Bennett, Corder, Cowen, Macfarren, Mackenzie, Smart,
Sullivan, Coleridge-Taylor among the younger men; in the United States,
Buck, Foote, Chadwick, Gilchrist, Paine, H. W. Parker, and Carl Busch.</p>

<h2>LESSON L.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Symphonic Poem in Germany</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Wagner’s Influence</b>.—The genius of Wagner produced and applied
to Opera a far richer and more complicated orchestration than had
existed before his day. Since then, in many periods and in many
countries, composers have tried to adopt his style, and apply it to
the symphonic as well as to the operatic stage. In the field of purely
orchestral music, Liszt and Berlioz had already formulated a free
style, and their symphonic poems, departing from the set form of the
symphony, have also served as models for later composers. Almost the
only recent exponent of the strict form was Johannes Brahms, for Anton
Bruckner, working on similar lines, did not achieve great success with
the public.</p>
<p><b>Richard Strauss</b>.—For many years it was thought that Wagner’s
orchestration would remain unrivalled in the field of music. But
Richard Strauss (born at Munich, Germany, 1864) has made a further
advance in this respect, and handles the full modern orchestra with
the utmost skill. Son of a court horn-player, his musical genius
showed itself in his earliest years, and his studies with the court
capellmeister, F. W. Meyer, resulted in the publication of several
works. At first he followed Brahms and the stricter school, and his
F-minor symphony is a worthy production in that form. A meeting with
von Bülow led to his appointment as assistant-conductor at Meiningen.
To show his ability, Strauss had to conduct, without rehearsal, his
Serenade, Op. 7, for thirteen wind instruments; and the excellence of
this work brought him the desired position. It was at this time that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
met Alexander Ritter, a man of broad intellect and radical ideas. Under
the new influence, Strauss renounced his classical style, and began
to compose the tone-pictures and symphonic poems that have made his
name so important. As he is the chief modern representative of the new
school, his works merit detailed examination.</p>
<p><b>His Early Symphonic Poems</b>.—After an Italian trip in 1886,
Strauss gave his impressions of that country in the form of the
symphonic fantasie “Aus Italien,” his first work in the free style of
subjective emotion-painting. It is in four movements, each a complete
tone-picture. The first, “On the Campagna,” gives a vivid impression
of spacious solitude, with a hint of the pageants and battles once
witnessed by this great Roman field. The second movement, “Amid Rome’s
Ruins,” aims also to give “fantastic pictures of vanished splendor,
feelings of sadness in the midst of the sunlit present.” The third
movement, “On the Shores of Sorrento,” resembles the symphonic scherzo,
while the finale gives an animated picture of “Neapolitan Folk-Life,”
introducing the air of “Funiculi” and other popular Italian tunes.</p>
<p>After four years of conducting at the Munich court theatre, Strauss
settled in Weimar, where he produced three more important works. The
first of these, “Macbeth,” showed that he had abandoned the old form in
favor of the symphonic poem, in which the different movements are fused
into one large whole, free in form. The picture of Macbeth, ambitious
and cruel in spite of his timidity, is ably developed, but the
portrayal of Lady Macbeth brings a still stronger climax of magnificent
orchestral power.</p>
<p>“Don Juan,” the second of the three, is founded on Lenau’s poem. The
hero is not a ruffian adventurer, as in Da Ponte’s libretto, but is
depicted as an arch pessimist, hunting through the world for perfection
in pleasure, but never finding it. There are restless and uncertain
melodies at the opening, to illustrate the hero’s unsatisfied longing.
A knightly theme follows, typical of Don Juan himself. Then come
various episodes, full of attractive enthusiasm, but always ending with
the same vague unrest. A wild carnival, followed by sudden silence and
the cutting theme of a trumpet, announce the hero’s end.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>
<p>“Tod und Verklärung” (Death and Transfiguration) is a work of great
power and beauty. It depicts an exhausted sufferer, asleep in the quiet
sick-room, dreaming of the beauty of his lost youth. Then follows a
more discordant episode, which may well picture a fierce contest with
the powers of disease, ending in defeated exhaustion. A third portion
brings renewed memories of the morning of life; passages of joyous
enthusiasm and noble aspiration suggest the high hope of youth and the
glorious achievement of manhood; but again comes the struggle with
the powers of Fate, ending in despair and death. The fourth part is
an apotheosis, representing the triumph of man’s upward striving over
death. This section contains some of the most impressive orchestral
beauties in the range of Strauss’ works.</p>
<p><b>Program Music</b>.—In the older symphonic form, it was not
necessary for the composer to suggest a title for his work. Many have
done so—Beethoven in his “Pastoral Symphony,” Mendelssohn in the
“Scotch,” for example; but the exquisite beauty of Schubert, or the
romantic charm of Schumann will impress the hearer without the use
of extraneous suggestions. In the modern school of program music,
founded by Liszt, the composer gives the audience a more or less
detailed account of the subject that inspired him, and tries to paint
in tones the events or moods suggested by the title. Much, therefore,
depends on the choice of the subject. If it is well-known, and gives
definite suggestions of certain moods which can find expression in
the orchestra, then it may receive legitimate treatment by being set
to music. But if the subject is not one that lends itself to broad
emotional treatment, or if the composer aims to picture definite events
or objects, he is departing from the true function of his art. Music
deals with expression of emotion, and should not attempt something
that belongs rather to other arts, such as Literature or Painting.
Many persons think that Strauss has gone too far in this direction,
especially in his later works.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>
<p><b>His Later Symphonic Poems</b>.—In “Till Eulenspiegel,” the hero is
a mediæval rogue, whose adventures are found in an old German tale. He
is a wandering mechanic, who does anything but tend to business. He is
always indulging in madcap pranks, in which he manages to escape from
his well-merited punishment. In the composition, Strauss has given
free rein to his fancy, and portrayed, with rare orchestral skill,
the fantastic jokes, the sly humor, and the rollicking disposition of
the graceless rogue. The work is in rondo form, with definite themes
to typify the hero. These themes form the basis of the music, and are
varied and developed with infinite skill and remarkable orchestral
irony.</p>
<p>“Also Sprach Zarathustra” (Thus Spake Zarathustra) is based on
Nietzsche’s mystic philosophy. Zarathustra, or Zoroaster, alms to teach
the doctrine of the “Over-Man,” by which man is to become a sort of
demigod who rises above good and evil into realms of joy. A picture
of the “Hinterweltlern,” or dwellers in the Rear-World of common
humanity, portrays their yearnings, their joys, and passions, while
their sorrows find voice in a tender “Grave-Song.” Science and its
futility are represented by a fugue replete with chromatics. A passage
entitled, “The Convalescent,” shows the defeat of the spirit of sorrow
and evil, and the triumph of joy. Then follows the wild, chaotic, but
strangely-effective “Dance-Song,” the exultation of the “Over-Man.”
Yet his triumph is not lasting, for at the close, after a sudden
stroke of the bell, comes the weird “Song of the Night-Wanderer,” and
the piece ends mystically in two different keys, as if representing
eternal doubt. Strange as this work may seem, its effect is one of
vast sublimity, and Nietzsche’s wild philosophy is translated into
orchestral effects of remarkable grandeur.</p>
<p>With “Don Quixote” Strauss enters the more definite field of program
music, and aims to picture events. It is cast in the variation form,
but is much more free in style than that title would imply. There is a
theme for the Don, clear at first, but becoming obscure and illogical,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
to show that he loses his sanity. He is represented by a solo ’cello,
while his faithful squire Sancho, strange to say, appears mostly in
viola passages. Each variation treats of one adventure. The windmills
are attacked, with disastrous results. The flock of sheep are heard,
bleating in full chorus until put to flight. The bands of pilgrims are
dispersed as robbers. The blindfold ride through the air on the wooden
horse is made realistic by the use of the theatrical wind-machine.
Other adventures follow, and at the end the knightly theme recurs in
a clarified form, to show Don Quixote’s return to reason and death.
It will readily be seen that this work is more experimental than the
earlier ones.</p>
<p>“Ein Heldenleben” represents the fight of Strauss with his adverse
critics. There are six well-marked sections. First comes the hero
himself, portrayed by definite themes that are woven into a strong
climax. Then his enemies are depicted, with remarkable irony, by a
medley of crackling, snarling figures for woodwind. The hero’s helpmate
is represented by a solo violin, and in this section an instrumental
love-duet is introduced. Then follows a picture of the hero’s
battlefield, ending in a song of victory. The hero’s works of peace are
then described, and the meaning of the composition is made clear by the
introduction of themes from the earlier works of Strauss. The final
section shows the hero’s departure from an ungrateful world. This piece
is grandly planned, but like other orchestral works of Strauss, its
themes are not melodic and lack musical charm.</p>
<p>The “Sinfonia Domestica” pictures a day in the composer’s family life.
Here, again, the subject is one that the hearer cannot understand
without an arbitrary explanation. Strauss has given no complete
analysis, but has deigned to explain that the three themes in the early
part represent father, mother and child, that the picture begins in the
afternoon and lasts until the next morning, and that the final fugue
represents the education of the child. The unmelodic style of Strauss
is little suited to such a subject, and the effect is such as to make
the work seem puzzling, at first, if not actually ridiculous.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>
<p><b>His Other Works</b>.—Of the two early operas by Strauss, “Guntram”
and “Feuersnoth,” neither has had real success; nor does his third
production, “Salome,” seem important. Guntram is a fighter for love,
a member of a mystic fraternity. He rescues Freihild from the tyranny
of Duke Robert, who loves her, and in the struggle he kills Robert.
Freihild falls in love with him, but he must renounce her, as he knows
that he killed Robert out of rivalry in love, an unworthy motive.
“Feuersnoth,” lighter in style, is based on the old legend of a
scornful maiden, whose pride meets punishment. All fire in the town
goes out, and no light can be rekindled, save by a touch of her body;
so that she finds herself exposed to the multitude. In this work, as in
“Heldenleben,” Strauss has introduced veiled attacks on his critics.
The music to both operas shows the usual richness of coloring and
orchestral intricacy, but their themes lack the direct power of the
guiding motives in Wagner’s works.</p>
<p><b>The Songs of Strauss</b> are many in number, and include some with
orchestral accompaniment. They show a modulatory style, combined with
a rare melodic beauty that seems strange in a composer who indulges in
so much orchestral ugliness. Some of these songs, such as “Traum durch
die Dämmerung” or “Allerseelen,” are gems of purest water. The songs
are often involved in style, but always possess unity and directness
of effect. Their beauty shows that the discords in the composer’s
orchestral works are intentional, and not due to lack of melodic
invention. Yet it would seem as if his great mastery of instrumental
coloring could have been employed as effectively in scoring beautiful
themes, instead of the commonplace passages so often found in his
larger works.</p>
<p><b>Hausegger</b>.—Siegmund von Hausegger (Graz, Austria, 1872) is
another master of the modern orchestra. His father was a musician of
broad experience and sound learning, so that it is not strange that his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
son’s gifts developed quickly. After his regular studies at the
gymnasium and the university, Siegmund took up music in earnest, under
his father and Degener. His youthful works were now augmented by a
piano quartet, a fantasia, the orchestral ballad “Odinsmeeresritt,”
the one-act drama “Helfried,” and the opera “Zinnober,” based on
a tale of Hofmann. These were followed by a number of songs and
choruses, but Hausegger’s real greatness was first revealed by the
“Dyonisiac Fantasie,” a symphonic poem for full orchestra. This was
followed by a still greater work, “Barbarossa,” while in 1904, at the
Frankfort festival, came “Wieland der Schmied.” “Barbarossa” is in
three movements. The first shows the happiness of the people gradually
fading into sorrow and pain, until the Barbarossa theme at last is
heard; for tradition says that the great emperor is not dead, but
sleeps in the mountain Kyffhäuser, waiting to arise when the need of
his people is too great to be borne. The second movement is a weird,
ghostly picture of the enchanted mountain and the sleeping emperor;
while the last depicts his awakening, his coming forth at the head of
his knights, their victory, and the rejoicing of the people. Wieland
is the wonderful smith whose swords cut off a head so cleanly that it
remains in place. The first movement shows his vision of the beautiful
maid Schwanhilde, appearing from celestial regions; but when he would
claim her, she retreats, terrified. A second part shows his sorrow and
despair. In the third movement hope again triumphs, and he forges for
himself a pair of wings. In the last movement the united lovers leave
the dull world behind, and take their flight to regions of eternal sunlight.</p>
<p><b>Other Orchestral Composers</b>.—<b>Gustav Mahler</b> (Kalisht,
Bohemia, 1860) gained his musical experience as a director in some of
the lesser theatres, and is largely self-taught. Besides two operas
and a number of beautiful songs, he has composed five symphonies. He
has tried to enlarge the symphonic form without departing from it. His
symphonies all aim to express some definite thought, such as pessimism
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
finding its cure in simple faith, love of nature leading to a high
idea of Pantheism, or doubt clearing in the joys of immortality.
The movements are arranged in contrasting groups, and voices are
introduced, at first solo, and then often in a final chorus of triumph.
Mahler’s works are planned on a grand scale, but his music is often
unclear and restless in effect. <b>Paul Felix Weingartner</b> (Zara,
Dalmatia, 1863) is another musician who served his apprenticeship in
the smaller theatres, and became one of the world’s great conductors.
He is known by his two symphonic poems, “King Lear” and “The Elysian
Fields,” as well as by two symphonies in strict form, and by several
chamber works. His opera “Genesius” and his classical trilogy “Orestes”
are other successful works. <b>Jean Louis Nicodé</b> (Jerczik, Posen,
1853) is somewhat older than the modern tone-poets, and if less
important is still noteworthy as an exponent of the program tendency.
His two greatest works are the “Symphonic Variations,” Op. 27, and “Das
Meer,” for male chorus, soloists, orchestra, and organ. The latter
is not a cantata, but rather a great suite, in which vocal movements
are balanced against orchestral numbers. Among younger men, <b>Hugo
Kaun</b> is familiar to Americans because of his long sojourn in
Milwaukee. His symphonic poems based on Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” show
much fluency and taste. Switzerland now has its set of young composers,
with <b>Hans Huber</b> as their leader in the orchestral field.</p>
<p><b>The Present Situation</b>.—The rich harmonies and free modulations
of Wagner, combined with the setting aside of symphonic form by Liszt,
have caused the more recent composers of Germany to give up almost
wholly the writing of symphonies. The free style of tone-picturing has
been widely adopted, in consequence of the example of Strauss. He has
gone so far that some of his works seem merely colossal experiments in
this direction, and it is not improbable that a revulsion from such
extreme musical impressionism will take place some time in the future.

<h2>LESSON LI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">German Opera Since Wagner</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Goldmark</b>.—Among those opera composers who are not direct
imitators of Wagner, Carl Goldmark (Keszthely, Hungary, 1830) is the
most noted. Son of a cantor in a synagogue, he showed decided musical
taste while still a child, and at twelve played the violin in public.
After a few conservatory lessons at Vienna, he was forced to make his
own way, and live on the small salary obtained in theatre orchestras.
He taught himself piano and singing, and was soon able to teach
others also. He trained himself by reading the scores of the great
master-works. In purely orchestral composition, his first success came
with the “Sakuntala” overture, inspired by the story of the Oriental
nymph of that name, who is wooed, forgotten, and found again by the
Indian king, Dushianta. Later overtures are “Penthesilea,” “Spring,”
“Prometheus Bound,” and “Italy.” Goldmark wrote two symphonies, the
first (“Rustic Wedding”) resembling a suite of tone-pictures, while the
second is in stricter form. He has also published a violin concerto,
some chamber works, and vocal pieces. His music is marked by richness
of harmony and warmth of instrumental coloring.</p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>Goldmark’s Operas</b>.—His first opera was
the “Queen of Sheba,” dealing with the infatuation of Assad for that
queen, at the court of King Solomon. Its scenes of splendid festivity
and dramatic power, and its delightful music, won it an immense
success, and Goldmark was nicknamed “Court Composer to the Queen of
Sheba.” “Merlin,” his next work, is based on that wizard’s love for
Viviane, in the days of King Arthur. It contains much noble music, but
the libretto is weak and confused. “Heimchen am Herd” is an example
of the style of Folk-opera <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span> introduced by Humperdinck. It is a
setting of Dickens’ “Cricket on the Hearth,” and its music shows a
most delightful freshness and charm. “Die Kriegsgefangene” treats the
story of Achilles and Briseis with much expressive power, while “Götz
von Berlichingen” is a setting of Goethe’s novel of that title. “Der
Fremdling” (The Stranger) is a manuscript work.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="539" src="images/image473.jpg" width="450" id="img_images_image473.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Engelbert Humperdinck</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Humperdinck</b>.—Engelbert Humperdinck (Bonn, Germany, 1854) won
a remarkable success with his Folk-opera “Hänsel and Gretel,” a work
which has almost founded a new school in Germany. Humperdinck studied
architecture at first, but at Hiller’s advice took up music. “Hänsel
and Gretel” is the story of two poor children who are left in the woods
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
by their stepmother. They find a gingerbread house, inhabited by a
witch who wishes to eat them; but Gretel pushes her into her own oven,
and frees all the children previously under her spells. The greatness
of this work, like that of Weber’s operas, in their day, lies in its
union of the popular Folk-song style with the richness of modern
orchestration. The music is fresh and tuneful, with an appealing
sincerity that carries it directly to the heart. At a period when
other composers seemed able to produce nothing but weak imitations
of Wagner’s operas, this work won universal recognition. Humperdinck
has produced several other fairy operas, such as “Dornröschen,” “Die
Königskinder,” “Saint-Cyr,” and “Die Sieben Geislein,” but none of them
has gained any lasting success.</p>
<p><b>Kienzl</b>.—Another composer of originality is <b>Wilhelm
Kienzl</b> (Waizen-Kirchen, Austria, 1857). He studied at Graz, Prague,
Leipzig, and, finally, with Liszt, at Weimar. He, too, served as
conductor in small theatres. His first opera, “Urvasi,” is based on an
East Indian subject. Its music is brilliant, but lacking in dramatic
effect. “Heilmar der Narr” deals with the magic healing qualities
of a seventh son, who forfeits his power if rewarded; he cures his
sweetheart, but loses his gift because he wins her, whereupon she
sacrifices herself to bring back his skill. Kienzl’s greatest work
is “Der Evangelimann,” treating of a true story of two brothers in a
small Austrian hamlet. Both love the same girl, Martha, but she prefers
Mathias. Johannes, out of jealousy, sets fire to a house where the
lovers are meeting, and denounces Mathias as the incendiary. Martha
tries in vain to save him, and he is imprisoned for twenty years. At
the end of this term, Johannes, who has been prosperous and respected,
is confronted on his death-bed by Mathias, who forgives him. This
opera has been given in many countries, and translated into several
languages. Its music shows much dramatic force, and goes far to redeem
those scenes in the libretto that are lacking in action. A fourth opera
by Kienzl is the tragi-comedy “Don Quixote.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Schillings</b>.—Among the composers who have modelled their works
on those of Wagner is Max Schillings (Düren, Germany, 1868). He studied
law at first, like Schumann, but soon turned to music, and became one
of Wagner’s active assistants at Bayreuth. His “Ingwelde” is one of
the many Viking operas that have followed in the lead of “Tristan and
Isolde,” and aimed at effects of dramatic power. Ingwelde is forced by
a careless oath to follow Klause, enemy of her husband, Gest. Bran,
Klause’s brother, loves her also, and kills Klause. She returns to
Gest, but Bran follows and kills him too, after which the pair die
together. “Der Pfeifertag,” a later work, is evidently inspired by
“Die Meistersinger.” It is a confused account of various adventures
on “Pipers’ Day,” a mediæval festival. The chief episodes are the
reduction of an excessive toll paid by the pipers, the pretended death
of one of that Guild, who thus obtains a eulogy from a rival, and the
union of two pairs of lovers. The music, though worthy, can hardly
stand comparison with that of the great work upon which the opera was modelled.</p>
<p><b>Cyrill Kistler</b> (Augsburg, Germany, 1848) was at one time thought
to be Wagner’s real successor, but nearly all his works are now laid
aside. They show an evident striving after musical grandeur, but are
not wholly successful in attaining that effect. Kistler studied with
Lachner and others at Munich, but became a Wagner enthusiast in spite
of their formal training. In his first opera, “Kunihild,” the heroine
is wooed by one of three brothers, who is successful in the magic ride
necessary to win her. But there has been a feud between the houses,
and another brother, to prevent the marriage, kills the bridegroom. A
comic opera, “Eulenspiegel,” preceded by ten years the symphonic poem
of Strauss. “Baldurs Tod” is based on the beautiful Norse Saga of the
Sun-God. “Im Honigmond” is a smaller work, in romantic style. A more
important production in the same vein is “Röslein im Hag,” which bids
fair to be successful. “Der Vogt von Mühlstein” is a work of still more recent date.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>
<p class="space-below2"><b>August Bungert</b> (Mühlheim, Germany,
1846) studied at Cologne and Paris, taking up composition at Berlin
under the renowned Fr. Kiel. He has produced a light opera, “Die
Studenten von Salamanca,” a “Tasso” overture, and the symphonic poem
“Auf der Wartburg.” But his life-work has been the composition of a
Hexalogy, or set of six operas, on Homeric subjects. The first two,
“Achilles” and “Klytemnestra,” are from the Iliad, while the Odyssey
furnishes the material for “Kirke,” “Nausikaa,” “Odysseus Heimkehr,”
and “Odysseus Tod.” The abiding beauty of the old Greek poems has been
faithfully preserved in the librettos, and the music has reflected, to
some degree, the noble dignity of these epics. The first three works
of the Odyssey cycle have been given, and have produced an excellent
impression on the critics.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="502" src="images/image476.jpg" width="450" id="img_images_image476.jpg">
<p class="f120 space-below2"><b><span class="smcap">Siegfried Wagner</span></b>.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Siegfried Wagner</b> (Triebschen, Switzerland, 1869), son of the
immortal Richard, has an undoubted right to carry on the family
traditions. He studied with Kniese and Humperdinck, and became a very
energetic conductor. His first opera, “Der Bärenhäuter,” is the story
of a mediæval soldier who sells himself to the devil, but is redeemed by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
finding a sweetheart who will remain true during three years of
absence. “Herzog Wildfang,” the next work, treats of a fiery duke who
is made unpopular and supplanted by his crafty adviser, Mathias Blank.
Mathias is afterward caught in trying to win the beautiful Osterlind by
trickery, and his dishonesty in office is also exposed; whereupon the
rightful duke comes to his own again, and Osterlind marries her real
lover. “Der Kobold,” a third work, treats of the legend that the souls
of murdered children wander about as kobolds until released by the
sacrifice of the last of their race. “Bruder Lustig,” the fourth opera,
is based on an Austrian subject.</p>
<p><b>D’Albert</b>.—In Eugen d’Albert (Glasgow, Scotland, 1864), we find
a man of real musical gifts. He studied under such men as Stainer and
Prout in England, but he claims that his true musical education began
only in later days, under Richter and Liszt. He has won international
fame as a pianist, and has shown real musicianship in his purely
orchestral works. These include two concertos for piano, one for
violoncello, the “Esther” and “Hyperion” overtures, and a worthy
symphony; all showing harmonic beauty and richness of color, without
any inflation or exaggerated effects. His first opera, “The Ruby,”
tells of a princess imprisoned in the form of that magic gem, but
released by a poor young man who wins her. “Ghismonda” deals with the
love of a princess for a young man of low degree, but noble character.
On being surprised with the princess, he dies rather than reveal her
love for him, but she proclaims his chivalry to the world. “Gernot”
is an elfin opera, with much delicate music. “Die Abreise” shows the
reconciliation of a married couple who have begun to drift apart, and
the departure of the over-amorous cavalier who tried to widen the
breach for his own purposes. “Kain” is a weirdly effective one-act
drama, of the realistic school. “Der Improvisator” has for its libretto
a rather weak arrangement of Hugo’s “Angelo, Tyrant of Padua,” while
“Tiefland” is founded on a Spanish tale, in which true love triumphs
over the schemes of a wicked Alcalde.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Hugo Wolf</b> (Vienna, Austria, 1860—Vienna, 1902) had a constant
struggle with poverty, and enjoyed but a short period of fame before
yielding to insanity and death. His opera, “Der Corregidor,” is a
delightful work, in comic vein, and the humorous scenes on the stage
are treated with remarkable animation and skill in the orchestra.
The Corregidor is a Spanish magistrate, who is too much smitten with
Frasquita, the beautiful wife of the miller, Tio Lucas. The pair play
him many tricks, and the opera ends with his discomfiture before his
own consort. Wolf’s fame is much increased by the rare power and beauty
of his many songs. Especially worthy of note are the “Feuerreiter,”
“Gebet,” “Gesang Weylas,” and the “<i>Italienisches Liederbuch</i>.” His
symphonic poem, “Penthesilea,” is another important work. His style is
sometimes bizarre and involved, but his themes are always effective and significant.</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—<b>Max Bruch</b> (Cologne, Germany, 1838)
studied under Hiller, Reinecke, and Breuning. His chief opera,
“Hermione,” is not important, but he has won lasting fame by the
breadth and nobility of his epic cantatas, such as “Frithjof,”
“Odysseus,” “Arminius,” and others. His concertos and serenade for
violin are favorite works with soloists. <b>Ludwig Thuille</b>, a
friend of Strauss, is given high praise by musicians, and his new
opera “Gugeline” has been well received. <b>Heinrich Zollner</b> has
won a popular success by his setting of Hauptmann’s delicate play,
“The Sunken Bell.” <b>Hans Pfitzner</b> has produced an excellent work
in his romantic forest-opera, “Die Rose vom Liebesgarten.” <b>Leo
Blech’s</b> “Alpenkönig und Menschenfeind” has received numerous
performances, while <b>E. Klose’s</b> fairy opera, “Ilsebill,” is a
worthy example of its school.</p>
<p><b>Opera in Germany</b>.—Since Wagner’s time, there has been no
striking development in German opera, and his works still remain by
far the most important in that field. None can rival him in the power,
variety, and expressive qualities of his music. Strauss surpasses him
in intricacy and novelty of instrumental effects, but Wagner himself
first cleared the path in which Strauss was to follow. The greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
successes of Goldmark are those of twenty and thirty years ago.
Humperdinck’s one chief work is frankly popular in style, and its
attractiveness cannot fairly be compared with the grandeur of the
music-dramas, even though it should found a school of its own.
Bungert’s works, though well received, have not been given many
performances, while many of those who have tried to imitate Wagner have
echoed merely his outward mannerisms, and not the inward greatness of
his works. It must be remembered, however, that a world-genius like
that of Wagner does not appear in every country or every century, and
that his importance prevents his successors from gaining their full
meed of appreciation.</p>

<h2>LESSON LII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Old and New Schools in France</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Saint-Saëns</b>.—The end of the 19th century in France has been
marked by a decided contrast between the old and the new, Saint-Saëns
and Massenet writing in the older style, while the pupils of Franck
have striven after novelty in effect. Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns
(Paris, France, 1835) witnessed the rise and fall of Meyerbeer, and
the triumphs of Gounod, and was himself famous before the influence
of Wagner reached France. His style is marked by great diversity, and
displays equal skill in many different veins; but his music always
shows the utmost facility of expression, a mastery of the technic of
composing, and a remarkable ease and fluency. His has been a true
musical development, founded on rational lines. He was always a warm
admirer of Bach, Beethoven, and the Classical school, and while he
appreciated Liszt, Wagner and other modern masters, he did not abandon
the old ideas of form and melody. His works show the most exquisite
symmetry of detail, like that of a finely-carved monument enriched by
delicate tracery.</p>
<p><b>His Works</b>.—Saint-Saëns studied at the <i>Conservatoire</i>, under
Stamaty, Halévy, and Benoist. Though he failed in trying for the
<i>Prix de Rome</i>, he produced a worthy symphony when only sixteen. In
opera, his first success was the Biblical “Samson and Dalila,” a work
of expressive power and vivid coloring. “Le Timbre d’Argent” and “La
Princesse Jaune” are of earlier date. “Le Deluge,” is an operatic
cantata. “Etienne-Marcel” won some success in Paris, while “Henry VIII”
is a skilful blending of old and new styles. “Proserpine” and “Ascanio
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>”
followed, while “Phryne” is a dainty example of opéra comique.
“Parysatis,” “Déjanire,” and “Les Barbares” introduce grandiose effects
for open-air performances. “Helène” is a shorter work, again on a
Grecian subject. The composer’s versatility and smoothness of style
prevent him from obtaining the highest dramatic intensity, but his
music is always excellent. In the orchestral field, he has produced
four later symphonies, five piano concertos (that in G minor being
the favorite), and two suites. His symphonic poems include “Le Rouet
d’Omphale,” a delicious orchestral spinning-song; “Phaeton” and “La
Jeunesse d’Hercule,” also on mythical subjects; and the weird “Danse
Macabre.” His violin concerto in B minor is a great favorite.</p>
<p><b>Massenet</b>.—Jules Emile Frederic Massenet (Montreaux, France,
1842) is another <i>Conservatoire</i> pupil. Rejected at first by Bazin, as
lacking talent, he worked steadily onward, and from a player in small
cafés became one of the foremost figures in French music. His first
great triumph came with “Marie Madeleine” and “Eve,” which are not
strictly oratorios, but are more properly called sacred dramas. “La
Vierge” and “La Terre Promise” are of later date. These works treat
their subjects with modern spirit and passion, instead of the more
classic oratorio style. Massenet is hardly the equal of Saint-Saëns
in orchestral work, but his “Phedre” overture and his suites of
tone-pictures are remarkably attractive. In opera, he won his spurs
with “Le Roi de Lahore,” a spectacular Oriental subject. “Herodiade” is
a sacred work, while “Manon” is a graceful setting of Prevost’s novel
of that name. “Le Cid” is not so strong a work, for Massenet’s style
is sentimental and passionate rather than heroic. “Esclairmonde,” with
a romantic and legendary plot, displays remarkable beauty and richness
of effect. “Werther,” based on Goethe’s novel, is another success. “Le
Mage,” an Oriental subject, and “Thais,” with an Egyptian plot, were
comparative failures. “La Navarraise,” with its love amid battles, is
an echo of Italian realism. Massenet’s tender feeling and vivid emotion
show at their best in his later works for the stage—“Le Portrait de
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
Manon,” a delightful love-idyl, “Cendrillon,” a fairy opera,
“Griselidis,” an old legend of wifely constancy, and “Le Jongleur de
Notre-Dame.” The last is a touching story of a despised minstrel who
wins favor with the Holy Virgin by his earnest desire to do something
in her name, even if it be only to amuse her with his juggling tricks.</p>
<p><b>French Opera</b>.—Among other French composers for the stage,
Meyerbeer, Gounod and Bizet belong to a previous generation.
<b>Delibes</b> won some notice with “Le Roi l’a Dit” and “Sylvia,”
but his best work is “Lakmé,” another example of rich Oriental warmth
and color. <b>Ambroise Thomas</b> is known chiefly as the composer of
“Mignon,” a remarkably graceful setting of a libretto from Goethe’s
“Wilhelm Meister.” “Le Songe d’un Nuit d’Été,” an earlier work,
has also met with deserved success, but “Hamlet” is a ridiculous
perversion of Shakespeare, and “Françoise de Rimini” failed to attain
real tragic grandeur. <b>Guiraud</b> is known by his comic opera
“Piccolino”; <b>Poise</b> set many of Molière’s plays; <b>Lalo’s</b>
only notable work is “Le Roi d’Ys”; <b>Godard’s</b> dainty “Vivandière”
is frankly light in style; while <b>Salvayre’s</b> ambitious “Dame
de Monsoreau” is not a great success. <b>Reyer’s</b> “Erostrate” and
“La Statue” were praised in their day, but he is better known by two
later works—“Sigurd,” on the subject of “Die Götterdämmerung,” and
“Salammbô,” a setting of Flaubert’s story of Carthage.</p>
<p><b>Franck and His Influence</b>.—The new French school is almost
wholly due to the work of one man, César Auguste Franck (Liége,
Belgium, 1822—Paris, 1890). He settled in Paris, and studied at the
<i>Conservatoire</i>. Modest and retiring by nature, “le bon père Franck,”
as he was called, divided his time between teaching, composing, and
playing the organ of the Ste. Clotilde Church. His simple faith and
earnest work recall the spirit of the old mediæval artists, who devoted
their lives and their music to the glory of the Lord. Franck’s works
show a mastery and power that his pupils are scarcely able to equal,
and his compositions have fairly won the esteem that was denied to them
during the composer’s lifetime. Among them are the great D minor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
Symphony, the oratorios “Ruth,” “Rebecca,” and “The Redemption,” the
opera “Hulda,” and the symphonic poems “Psyche” (with voices), “Les
Djinns,” “Les Eolides,” and “Le Chasseur Maudit.” But Franck’s most
notable work is “Les Beatitudes,” an eight-part oratorio treating the
Sermon on the Mount. Franck’s style is radically different from that
of Saint-Saëns or Massenet. It is harmonic rather than melodic, and
extremely modulatory in effect. His progressions remind the hearer
of Wagner; but they do not always possess the broad simplicity that
underlies Wagner’s most intricate passages. Franck’s pupils have often
fallen into the error of imitating his weakest points, and have brought
about a style of harmonic vagueness that seems meaningless to many
modern critics.</p>
<p><b>D’Indy</b>.—Vincent d’Indy (Paris, France, 1852) is the greatest
of Franck’s pupils, and the leader of the modern French school. As
conductor, he has been an ardent champion of new and little-known
works. His own compositions include many forms, and have all
attracted attention. His first great work to reach the public was
the “Piccolomini” overture, a part of his orchestral trilogy based
on Schiller’s “Wallenstein.” Two important vocal compositions are
“La Chevauchée du Cid,” for baritone, chorus, and orchestra, and “Le
Chant de la Cloche,” a dramatic legend that won the prize given by the
city of Paris. In the orchestral field, “Antony and Cleopatra” is an
early work, as is also the “Jean Hunyadi” symphony. Of d’Indy’s two
later symphonies, the first, based on a mountain air, contains many
passages of sweetness and purity, while the second is more involved and
modulatory in style. His earliest symphonic poem, “La Forêt Enchantée”
is a delicate tone-picture based on a ballad of Uhland; “Saugefleurie”
is founded on a story by de Bonnières; while “Istar” is inspired by
parts of the old Assyrian epic “Idzubar.” D’Indy’s music is hardly
popular in style, for its themes are not definitely melodic; but his
skill in weaving them into an orchestral tissue is admired by all
musicians. In opera, “Les Burgraves” and the lighter “Attendez-Moi Sous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
l’Orme” are youthful works, while “Fervaal” is a music-drama (<i>action
musicale</i>) on a Druidic subject, and “L’Etranger” is symbolic in style.
He has written some important works in musical literature and theory.</p>
<p><b>Charpentier</b>.—Gustave Charpentier (Dieuze, France, 1860) was
a <i>Conservatoire</i> pupil. The <i>Prix de Rome</i> took him to Italy, and
his life there resulted in the pleasing orchestral suite “Impressions
d’Italie.” This consists of five tone-pictures, entitled, “Serenade,”
“At the Fountain,” “On Muleback,” “On the Summits,” and “Naples.”
On his return he lived among the working-people of Montmartre, and
their life is reflected in his later works. “La Vie du Poète” is a
symphony-drama, giving episodes in the life of an unsuccessful genius.
In the beginning, all is aspiration and enthusiasm. Then doubt follows.
At first the poet is consoled by the serene beauty of the summer night,
but his fears gain the upper hand. Then comes a picture of impotent
raging and vain anger against fate, after which the poet tries to blot
out his sorrows in the cheap gayety of the city. “La Couronnement de la
Muse” is a pantomime, written with the idea that a working girl in each
town or city should annually be chosen and crowned amid festivities.
The composer’s greatest work, however, is the opera “Louise.” This
tells the story of a poor working girl, whose parents forbid her to
marry the somewhat wayward Julien. At the latter’s persuasion, she
finally flies with him. Her parents try to reclaim her, but again she
is drawn away, and her father is left shaking his fist at the terrible
city that entices young girls from their homes. The music of “Louise”
is full of power and realism, and even the street cries of Paris are
echoed in its measures.</p>
<p><b>Bruneau</b>.—Operatic realism has found a more prolific, if less
successful, champion in Alfred Bruneau (Paris, France, 1857), another
<i>Conservatoire</i> pupil. He has confined himself to librettos drawn from
the novels of Zola. “Le Rêve,” an early work, is a psychological study
of love, in the person of the dreamy Angelique, who dies from excess of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
happiness when her wedding is completed. “L’Attaque du Moulin” is
a spirited story of the Franco-Prussian war, set in a more melodic
and popular style. “Messidor” is again symbolic in style, the theme
being a contrast between greed for gold and the simple pleasure of
honest toil. “L’Ouragan” deals with the tempests of human passion and
jealousy, as well as the hurricanes of nature. “L’Enfant Roi,” and the
music to “La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret,” are more recent works. Bruneau is
sincere and earnest in his efforts at realism, but his music is often
heavy and uninspired. He has produced works in other fields, among
them being a great “Requiem,” a “Heroic Overture,” and the symphonic
poem “Penthesilée,” for voice and orchestra. His three books on French
composers, and his many criticisms, have made him known in the domain
of musical literature.</p>
<p><b>Debussy</b>.—The new school of French music finds its most radical
expression in the compositions of Achille Claude Debussy (Paris,
France, 1862). A musician of great gifts, he chooses to imbue his
music with a studied vagueness of effect, and wanders through a maze
of changing keys and harmonies. Many persons find the result wholly
incomprehensible at first, but on repeated hearing his works show
a weird, elusive beauty that is worshipped by his adherents as the
acme of musical expression. He, too, was a <i>Conservatoire</i> student,
and won the <i>Prix de Rome</i> with the cantata “L’Enfant Prodigue.”
Two lyric scenes, “La Demoiselle Élue,” and “Chimène,” first drew
attention to the young artist. Then came the orchestral prelude to
Mallarmé’s “L’Après-Midi d’un Faune,” a delicately-woven rhapsody,
with much beauty and much weirdness in its harmonies. The Nocturnes,
entitled, “Nuages” and “Fêtes,” are described by De Bréville as
possessing the ethereal charm of a perfume that pervades the air,
but defies analysis. A string quartet is in stricter form, but the
“Proses Lyriques,” on subjects of Beaudelaire, also the “Chansons de
Bilitis” and “Les Estampes” for piano, again show the free style.
Debussy’s most ambitious work is “Pelleas et Mélisande,” an opera based
on Maeterlinck’s play of that name. The poet’s words offer the same
shadowy suggestions that the composer gives in music, and the harmonic
effects of vague mystery are entirely in place here.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Chausson</b>.—Ernest Chausson (Paris, France, 1855—Limay, 1899)
proved himself a composer of real greatness, and was still in the prime
of life when he met with a fatal bicycle accident, in 1899. Trained
for law, he turned to music from choice, as Schumann did before him.
A pupil of Massenet and Franck, he combined the direct expression of
the former with the harmonic style of the latter, and produced works
of a most attractive orchestral coloring. Among his compositions are a
worthy symphony, the beautiful symphonic poem “Viviane,” the orchestral
pictures “Solitude dans les Bois” and “Soir de Fête,” a “Poëme” for
violin and orchestra, some chamber-music, and many pleasing songs and
choruses. His one great opera was “Le Roi Arthus.” His works are full
of tenderness and charm, yet not lacking in vigor and breadth; they
have the modern harmonic richness and orchestral color, and are growing
steadily in favor.</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—<b>Alexis Emanuel Chabrier</b>, wholly
self-taught in music, produced the brilliant orchestral rhapsody
“España,” an attractive “Suite Pastorale,” a lively “Marche Joyeuse,”
and some effective cantatas. In opera, his “Le Roi Malgré Lui” is
an excellent example in lighter vein, but his greatest work is
“Gwendoline,” on a Viking subject. Of all the Frenchmen, he was
the one best fitted to attempt the bold, virile style required by
the libretto. The most prominent orchestral writer of the younger
generation is <b>Paul Dukas</b>, whose “Apprenti Sorcier” treats a
humorous subject with rare skill. <b>Théodore Dubois</b>, for many
years head of the <i>Conservatoire</i>, is best known by his oratorios, such
as “Paradise Lost,” and his “Frithjof” overture. <b>Gabriel Fauré</b>,
the organist, who succeeded Dubois as director of the <i>Conservatoire</i>
in 1905, has produced a symphony, two string quartets, and a number
of songs whose intricacy cannot obscure their exquisite grace. Other
organist-composers are <b>Charles Marie Widor</b>, who wrote the opera
“Maître Ambros” and the ballet “La Korrigane,” and <b>Alexandre
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
Guilmant</b>, known by his great organ symphony and sonatas.
<b>Bourgault-Ducoudray</b> has written many cantatas, and made
a valuable collection of Breton Folk-songs. <b>Pierné</b>,
<b>Coquard</b>, <b>Erlanger</b> and <b>Hue</b> won their fame in opera,
while <b>Duparc</b> gained notice with his symphonic poem “Lenore.”
<b>Ropartz</b> and <b>de Bréville</b> rank with the best of Franck’s
pupils, while among women-composers, <b>Augusta Holmés</b> won renown
by her mastery of broad orchestral effects, and <b>Cécile Chaminade</b>
is known by her dainty songs and piano pieces.</p>
<p><b>The New French School</b>.—When Wagner showed the harmonic
resources of the modern orchestra, he led the way for a host of
imitators, who have often done more harm than good. Such operas as
“Fervaal” and “Gwendoline,” in large measure the result of “Tristan,”
are proper applications of this style. But the idea of finding new
harmonic effects has exerted its influence on orchestral writers also,
and some modern composers, especially in France, have devoted all
their energy to this, and have apparently sacrificed all thoughts of
musical beauty. The French have even invented the term “cérébral,”
which describes a composer who puts no emotion or feeling into his
music, but works it out wholly from the brain. Thus many of the modern
compositions must be regarded as great orchestral experiments, and the
composer who combines this instrumental technic with real feeling and
directness of utterance is the one who will meet with the greatest success.</p>

<h2>LESSON LIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Musical Regeneration in Italy</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Musical Decadence</b>.—When a nation clings to its own musical
ideas, and persistently disregards the growth and progress of other
nations, it usually enters upon a period of decay. This is what took
place in Italy during the 19th century, and the country that produced
Palestrina and the Scarlattis seemed for a time to understand nothing
but the trivial operatic melodies of Rossini’s successors. In 1850,
there were scarcely any concert halls in the country, and even the
churches were content with operatic airs set to sacred words. Soon
after this, Pinelli tried to give an orchestral concert, with sixty
musicians; and the box-office receipts left only fourteen francs with
which to pay them. Sgambati produced a Beethoven symphony, but had to
do it at his own expense. As late as 1879, Saint-Saëns, who gave an
organ recital at Milan, found the organ scarcely fit for an artist to
play upon. In opera, it was only the broad judgment of Verdi that was
able to look beyond the borders of his native land, and his “Aïda,”
as well as Boïto’s “Mefistofele,” was the beginning of a new order of things.</p>
<p><b>Mascagni</b>.—In 1890, the publisher Sonzogno offered a prize for
the best one-act opera submitted to him, and this prize was awarded to
Pietro Mascagni (Leghorn, Italy, 1863), then an unimportant musical
leader at Cerignola. Mascagni was the son of a baker, who wished him to
study law, and locked him up because he practiced the piano in secret.
The boy was rescued by his uncle, and under the protection of Count
Florestan pursued his studies at the Milan Conservatory. The opera
that brought him such fame, which has since become world-wide, was
“Cavalleria Rusticana,” or “Rustic Chivalry,” based on a tale by Verga.
The scene is a village square, before a church. The heroine, Santuzza,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
is forsaken by Turiddu, who carries on an intrigue with Lola, wife of
the carter Alfio. Santuzza, in despair, denounces him to Alfio, who
challenges and kills him. The music is hardly of the highest standard;
but it is popular and vigorous in style, and intensely powerful. The
work is scarcely comparable to the music-dramas, yet every number is
animated by the spirit of the words, and it is therefore dramatically
true. Among the many favorite selections from its score are the
“Siciliana” of Turiddu (sung as part of the overture, before the
curtain rises), the broad and noble “Regina Coeli,” Lola’s serenely
confident aria, “My King of Roses,” and the jolly “Brindisi,” or
drinking chorus, to say nothing of the saccharine “Intermezzo.” The
power and vividness of “Rustic Chivalry” made it an epoch-making work;
but Mascagni’s later operas have not met with the same success. They
include “L’Amico Fritz,” “William Ratcliff,” “Silvano,” “Iris,” “Le
Maschere,” and the one-act “Amica.”</p>
<p><b>Leoncavallo</b>.—The success of “Rustic Chivalry” aroused Ruggiero
Leoncavallo (Naples, Italy, 1858) to try his hand in the same school.
His early opera “Chatterton” was practically a failure, while his
ambitious “Medici” trilogy (“I Medici,” “Savonarola,” and “Cesare
Borgia”) met with no better reception. In “I Pagliacci,” however, he
produced a work of the new school, that has taken its place beside
Mascagni’s opera as an example of the new realism. The “Pagliacci”
are strolling players. Canio, the leader, is aroused to madness by
learning of the proposed elopement of his wife, Nedda, but she will not
betray her lover’s name. They enact for the villagers a mimic tragedy
of love and jealousy, but Canio makes it real by actually stabbing the
faithless Nedda. Her lover then leaps from the audience to save her,
only to meet a similar death at Canio’s hands. The music to this play
is of a higher standard than Mascagni’s, though less directly popular
in style. “Trilby” and “Zaza” are later works of little importance,
while “Roland of Berlin,” composed by order for a libretto by the
Emperor of Germany, aroused only passing interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Puccini</b>.—When the great Verdi retired from active life as a
composer, he named as his probable successor, Giacomo Puccini (Lucca,
Italy, 1858). Descended from a musical family, Puccini could devote
himself to his art without parental opposition, and he completed his
studies under Ponchielli, at the Milan Conservatory. His “Le Villi”
was really the origin of the modern one-act plays. “Edgar” resembles
“Carmen” somewhat, but has a weak libretto, and music that is not
always effective. “Manon Lescaut” is rather a succession of detached
scenes than a single whole, but at times it displays a mastery of
dramatic contrast far beyond Massenet. “La Bohême” is a delightfully
sympathetic setting of Murger’s well-known novel, and its scenes of
rollicking defiance to poverty and hunger remind one of the composer’s
early struggles. The note of haunting sweetness that pervades the score
marks Puccini as a man of rare musical gifts. In “Tosca,” the heroine
of that name loves the artist, Mario, who aids a political refugee,
at the risk of his own life. The governor, Scarpia, who captures him,
loves Tosca also, and tortures him to make her yield to his desires.
To save Mario, she consents, but stabs Scarpia at the last moment. But
Scarpia’s treachery survives him, for the pretended execution, which
was to let Mario escape, turns out to be real, and Tosca takes her own
life in despair. The music shows a ripe mastery of dramatic power.
The climax of the first act, merging into the church service, and the
tragic power of the second, well contrasted with the strains of a
festival cantata that float in through the window, are scenes that win
unqualified praise from all critics. “Madame Butterfly,” on a Japanese
subject, lacked the necessary delicacy, but the two preceding works
have made Puccini the foremost man in Italian opera today.</p>
<p><b>The Realistic School</b>.—Many composers of the “Verismo” school
adopt a realism that deals only with the more brutal side of life, and
their plots, though strong, are not always pleasing. <b>Giordano’s</b>
“Andrea Chenier” and “Fedora” show musical worth, but <b>Spinelli’s</b>
“A Basso Porto,” <b>Coronaro’s</b> “Festa a Marina,” and <b>Tasca’s</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
“A Santa Lucia” picture some of the coarsest phases of existence. Yet
this defect may be condoned when we consider that the movement has
infused new life and power into Italian music. Among those composers
who have stood somewhat aloof from the new school, <b>Franchetti</b>
is the most noteworthy. His operas include “Cristoforo Colombo,”
“Germania,” and the later “Figlia di Jorio,” and he has written
symphonies that place him among the best of the later Italian composers.</p>
<p><b>Perosi</b>.—The revival in sacred music has been brought about
wholly by one man, Don Lorenzo Perosi (Tortona, Italy, 1872). He
studied faithfully, in spite of sickness—first at Milan, then under
the learned Fr. Haberl at Ratisbon. He became a conductor at Imola,
and afterwards at Venice, where he led his forces with decided vigor.
Soon after this, he began to compose the oratorios that have made
him so famous. His sacred trilogy, “The Passion of Christ,” included
the “Last Supper,” the “Sermon on the Mount,” and the “Death of the
Redeemer.” It made a sensation that reverberated through all Italy,
and caused his appointment in the following year as honorary master of
the Papal Choir. He has been untiring as a composer, producing no less
than fifteen masses and nearly a dozen oratorios. Among the latter are
“The Transfiguration,” “The Annunciation,” “The Raising of Lazarus,”
“The Birth of the Redeemer,” and the two-part “Moses.” He writes with
enthusiasm, and sees the actual picture before him while he works. His
music does not possess the calm dignity shown by Palestrina, but its
semi-popular style is well adapted to his hearers, and may lead the way
to something better.</p>
<p><b>Sgambati</b>.—The leading position among Italy’s new symphonic
composers belongs to Giovanni Sgambati (Rome, Italy, 1843). Like
many musicians, he was at first destined for a lawyer’s career, but
began his musical studies in time to become known as a boy-prodigy.
He settled in Rome, and soon grew famous as a pianist. He played
Beethoven, Schumann and Chopin, and did much to introduce their works
into Italy. He planned a trip to Germany, but when Liszt came to Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
he remained there to study under that great master. At this time his
earlier compositions, mostly chamber works, brought him into notice in
a new field. These quartets and quintets were followed by a festival
overture, a piano concerto, and three symphonies in succession. His
compositions are somewhat lacking in spontaneity, but they display
great learning, and undeniable skill. His works show the influence of
Liszt and Berlioz, mingled with the stricter style of the old Italian
contrapuntal writers.</p>
<p><b>Other Orchestral Composers</b>.—With Sgambati, <b>Martucci</b> also
deserves mention in the instrumental field. He became identified with
the artistic life of Naples, where he fought a similar fight for the
cause of good music. Among several others, <b>Del Valle de Paz</b> is
noted for his valuable educational work in Florence, no less than for
his compositions. <b>Busoni</b>, so well known as a pianist, has also
tried his hand at orchestral writing in the most extreme modern vein.
Eugenio di Pirani is another composer who has identified himself with
the German instrumental school. The literary champion of the new order
of things has been Luigi Torchi, whose work in the magazines deserves
the highest praise.</p>
<p><b>Bossi</b>.—The most prominent figure among the younger devotees
of the German style is Marco Enrico Bossi (Salo, Italy, 1861). He
studied organ at first, and for ten years held the post of organist
in the Como Cathedral. Four years of teaching at Naples were followed
by similar work in Venice, where he gained deserved prominence. His
compositions show great originality, and include many different forms.
An early overture was given at the Crystal Palace, in London, which he
visited during a piano tour. The one-act opera “Paquita” was followed
by “L’Angelo della Notte” and “Il Veggento,” also a large work for the
Milan Exposition of 1905. He has composed many masses, and the oratorio
“Christus.” A more recent triumph is “Paradise Lost,” with Milton’s
words—a work suggested by Mme. Rubinstein. His organ concerto won
a decided success at the Chicago Fair, and his symphonic poem, “Il
Cieco,” has been well received. He aims to blend the old polyphonic
style with the rich instrumentation of modern Germany.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Buongiorno</b>.—Among the adherents of German standards, Buongiorno
(Bonito, Italy, 1864) is one who has devoted himself to opera. Studying
at the Naples Conservatory, he became leader of an operetta troupe,
for which he wrote many popular works. His first great opera was “Das
Mädchenherz” (Il Cuor delle Fanciulle), which treats with admirable
delicacy the love-story of Alba and Marino. She grows to be court
singer, and defeats an older rival, but ambition makes her careless of
love. Marino becomes a priest, and only when Alba is old and forsaken
does his consolation show her what she has missed. The music displays
much emotional beauty, and the “play within the play,” at the ducal
court, allows the composer to imitate Bach, Handel, and other old
masters with exquisite humor. “Michelangelo and Rolla” is a one-act
play, again uniting a subject of real poetic worth with beautiful
music. These two operas are far removed from the crudities of the
“Verismo” school.</p>
<p><b>Wolf-Ferrari</b>.—A composer who may fitly follow German ideals is
Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, son of a German father and an Italian mother.
His “Cenerentola” (Cinderella) has a rather tedious first act, but the
second act shows all the appealing beauty and sympathetic feeling that
mark the new romanticism. “Le Donne Curiose” is an excellent example of
sparkling comedy, and has won much success in Germany. It treats of the
misadventures of some women, who try to investigate a mysterious club
formed by their husbands. A work in a different vein is the composer’s
“Vita Nuova,” a fresh and inspired setting of sonnets and other
selections from Dante’s great work.</p>
<p><b>Music in Italy</b>.—It is difficult for one nation to adopt the
musical expression of another, but this is practically what Italy has
done. Verdi first gave up the trivial melodies so dear to the Italian
populace, and adopted a worthier style. Like Boïto, he denied being
influenced by Wagner, but his works show that he felt the force of the
German master’s orchestral power. The realistic school of opera has
brought into Italian music a vividness and power that are not surpassed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
by any other nation, while a still later generation has striven to cast
off the crudities of this school and produce works of real orchestral
value. Italy has already done much, and the progress of the last few
decades seems to predict a bright future for her music.</p>
<p><b>Music in Spain</b>.—During the last half-century, Spain, too,
has developed some native composers. One of the best is <b>Isaac
Albeniz</b>, whose “Pepita Ximenes” is a delightful comedy of love
and intrigue. His Zarzuelas also have met with success. <b>Felipe
Pedrell</b>, well known in European journalism, has written an
ambitious trilogy on subjects illustrating the national motto, “Patria,
Fides, Amor.” Larrocha, Vives, De Lara, and Antonio Noguerra are
also worthy of mention. The Zarzuela is the peculiar Spanish form of
light opera, resembling the Italian opera buffa, but possessing more
brilliance and delicacy.</p>

<h2>LESSON LIV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">England and the Netherlands</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Music in England</b>.—In the Middle Ages, the much-used art
of Counterpoint was developed by the people of England and the
Netherlands. In the Elizabethan age, the music of England was scarcely
less important than her literature. Under Charles II, she could boast
of Henry Purcell, one of the few great names in music. But in the 19th
century her musical glory had faded, and sentimental songs and popular
ballad-operas seemed all that she could produce. Her musical leaders
went bravely to work, importing such composers as Mendelssohn and
Wagner, and building up great music schools. There was, however, no
high standard of taste in the country, so the task proceeded slowly.
A race that is gifted with real love of music, and possesses worthy
Folk-songs, can easily develop great composers; but England, like the
United States, is too commercial for the best results. Dvořák once
said of the English people: “They do not love music; they respect it.”</p>
<p><b>Stanford</b>.—For some years, a group of five men were the
advance guard of England’s development. While none of them showed
any remarkable inspiration, their work was learned and thorough, and
prepared the way for men of more originality. The foremost of them
was Charles Villiers Stanford (Dublin, Ireland, 1852). After studying
under Reinecke and Kiel, he became organist and conductor at Cambridge
University. His works include five symphonies (among them the “Irish”),
two overtures, an “Irish Rhapsody,” a piano concerto, two oratorios,
and several cantatas; but he is best known by his operas. Of these,
“Shamus O’Brien” is most popular, because of its subject, while “Much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
Ado about Nothing” shows much grace and elegance. “The Canterbury
Pilgrims” aims to picture old England, as the “Meistersinger” did old
Germany. Stanford’s work is always carefully planned, but not deeply inspired.</p>
<p><b>Parry</b>.—Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (Bournemouth, England,
1848) fills a similar position at Oxford University. He has composed
four symphonies, and two overtures, the “Tragic” and “Guillem de
Cabestanh,” but his most important work has been in the field of
oratorio. His sacred works include “Judith,” “De Profundis,” “Job,”
and “King Saul,” also a great Magnificat and Te Deum. These, too, show
excess of erudition, and are somewhat academic in character; but in
all his choral work, Parry displays a breadth and power that deserve
high praise. His incidental music to the “Frogs” and the “Birds” of
Aristophanes is also worthy of mention. His contributions to musical
literature are very important.</p>
<p><b>Other Musical Leaders</b>.—<b>Alexander Campbell Mackenzie</b>
(Edinburgh, Scotland, 1847) became teacher and conductor in his native
city, afterwards joining the University forces. His “Colomba,” an
early opera, displays much real dramatic worth; more, in fact, than
his later productions. Among his other works are two oratorios, “The
Rose of Sharon” and “Bethlehem,” while his entr’actes for “Manfred” and
his powerful “Coriolanus” music also deserve notice. <b>Frederic Hymen
Cowen</b> (Kingston, Jamaica, 1852) studied with Reinecke, Moscheles,
and Kiel, and conducted in many cities, including Melbourne, Australia.
He has written two oratorios, “Ruth” and “The Deluge,” four operas,
including “Pauline” and “Harold,” and several cantatas, of which “The
Sleeping Beauty” and “The Water Lily” are delightfully poetic. But
his six symphonies are his most valuable works, the “Scandinavian,”
“Idyllic,” and “Welsh” ranking in the order named. <b>Arthur Goring
Thomas</b> (Eastbourne, England, 1850—London, 1892) devoted himself
to the lighter style of romantic music, in which his opera “Esmeralda”
and his posthumous cantata “The Swan and the Skylark” met with the most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
success. With these five should be classed <b>Sir J. Frederick
Bridge</b>, often called in jest “The Westminster Bridge” because of
his post as organist in Westminster Abbey. His works include many
cantatas, oratorios, and lesser sacred pieces. His teaching has been
made delightful by his inimitable humor, which often appears in his
compositions also. Other men of this school are <b>Walter Cecil
Macfarren</b>, <b>Sir Walter Parratt</b>, and <b>Charles Harford Lloyd</b>,
while the excellent work of <b>Sir Arthur Sullivan</b> in light opera
must not be forgotten.</p>
<p><b>Elgar</b>.—In Edward William Elgar (Broadheath, England, 1857) we
find a man who is possessed of real originality, and takes rank with
the world’s great composers. This is all the more remarkable when we
consider that he is almost wholly self-taught. Son of an organist, he
soon grew familiar with the instrument, and gained further musical
experience by playing in a theatre orchestra at Worcester. Too poor to
go to Germany, he lived by teaching violin at first. He went through
various books on harmony and orchestration, gaining much from Mozart’s
“Thorough-Bass School,” and Parry’s articles in Grove’s dictionary.
He ruled a score for the same number of bars and instruments as in
Mozart’s G-minor symphony, and wrote a work in this form—an exercise
which he considers of the utmost value. When he obtained a new
orchestral work, he would go into the fields to study it.</p>
<p><b>His Works</b>.—Elgar first won attention by his cantata “The
Black Knight,” given at a Worcester festival. Its success caused him
to continue with “The Light of Life” and “King Olaf,” the latter
displaying much direct power and orchestral mastery. His “Variations,”
which won a London triumph, possess great intrinsic worth; but each one
is intended to portray some friend of the composer’s, and the work thus
has an added meaning for his acquaintances. “The Dream of Gerontius,”
a setting of Cardinal Newman’s sacred poem, met with remarkable favor.
It is not altogether unified in effect, but contains many passages of
compelling beauty and sublimity. It has been heard in many countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
and one German writer considers it the greatest sacred work of the
last century, except the “Requiem” of Brahms. “The Apostles,” a later
oratorio, is the first part of a proposed trilogy. It displays similar
excellence, but at times is too mystic and psychological in effect.
Other works by Elgar are three overtures: the attractive “Froissart,”
the broadly-popular “Cockaigne” (typical of London), and the more
recent “In the South.” The music to “Diarmid and Grania” is also
worth mention, while the five songs, entitled, “Sea Pictures,” show
remarkable breadth and nobility.</p>
<p><b>Coleridge-Taylor</b>.—England boasts the first great negro composer
in Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (London, England, 1875). Son of an educated
African father and a white mother, he began violin lessons at six.
At a more mature age, he studied piano with Ashton and composition
with Stanford. His early works included a number of anthems, some
chamber-music, and a symphony in A-minor. For his beloved violin he
wrote the passionate “Southern Love-Songs” and “African Romances,”
also the “Hiawatha” sketches. In 1898, he became world-famous by his
cantata “Hiawatha’s Wedding-Feast,” which he followed with “The Death
of Minnehaha” and “Hiawatha’s Departure.” These display a strength and
profusion of passion that sway all hearers, and the glowing richness
of the instrumentation forms an appropriate frame for Longfellow’s
picture. Later vocal works are “The Atonement” and “The Blind Girl of
Castel-Cuillé.” His other compositions include an orchestral ballade
with violin, an Idyll, a Solemn Prelude, the music to “Herod,” and four
waltzes. All show breadth of treatment, and effects of real beauty
attained by simple means.</p>
<p><b>Bantock</b>.—Some younger composers have headed a movement for
greater originality, under the lead of Granville Bantock (London,
England, 1868). His one-act operas “Caedmar” and “The Pearl of Iran”
show much warmth of color, and his musical ideas are always worthy of
the great literary conceptions in which he delights. His two overtures,
“Eugene Aram” and “Saul,” the suite of “Russian Scenes,” and the more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
recent rhapsody, “The Time Spirit,” are the work of a truly musical
nature. His greatest effort, however, is a set of twenty-four symphonic
poems, illustrating Southey’s “Curse of Kehama.”</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—In the new movement are William Wallace,
Erskine Allon, Reginald Steggall, Stanley Hawley, and Arthur Hinton.
Clarence Lucas and Cyril Scott are two other young men of prominence.</p>
<p><b>Edward German</b> is a composer of remarkable gifts, for he attains
effects of the utmost grace and musical beauty by the simplest diatonic
themes. His “Rival Poets” and “Merrie England” are worthy examples of
light opera, while the “English Fantasia,” the symphonic poem “Hamlet,”
the suite “The Seasons,” and the “Welsh Rhapsody” are all works of
pleasing freshness and originality. German has also made a name in the
special field of incidental music, his settings including “Romeo and
Juliet,” “As You Like It,” “Much Ado about Nothing,” “The Tempest,”
and several other plays. In a period when many composers are losing
themselves in the intricacies of the modern orchestral style, the clear
simplicity of German’s compositions is an example of the utmost value.</p>
<p><b>The Belgian School: Benoit</b>.—The new school of Belgium, fostered
by the Brussels Conservatory, owes its origin chiefly to Peter Benoit
(Harelbeke, Flanders, 1834—Antwerp, 1901), who broadened its influence
by his teaching at the Flemish School of Music, in Antwerp. His early
opera, “Het Dorp in t’ Gebergte” (The Village in the Mountains),
showed delightful local color. A second opera, a mass, a concerto, and
a choral symphony increased his fame, but he is identified chiefly
with the cantata. His great works in this field include “Oorlog”
(War), “Lucifer,” “De Schelde,” “De Rhyn,” the Rubens cantata, and
“Promethée.” They are modern in effect, and show breadth of conception
and real inspiration, united with ripe technical mastery. They have
been described as great decorative pictures in tone, suggesting vistas
of grand palaces, armies in battle array, rich fields of grain, mystic
visions of the spirit world, or gorgeous triumphal marches.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Gilson</b>.—Paul Gilson (Brussels, Belgium, 1865) has written for
orchestra a Dramatic Overture, a Festival Overture, a Canadian and an
Irish Fantasy, half a dozen suites, the “Bucolics” of Virgil, and other
lesser works. But his best-known composition is the set of symphonic
sketches entitled, “La Mer.” This illustrates a poem of Levis,
frequently read before the performance. The different movements depict
sunrise at sea, and the many-colored splendors of dawn; the rollicking
songs and lively dances of the seaman; a love-duet and parting between
a sailor and his sweetheart; and a fatal tempest, in which the themes
of the sailors’ choruses are introduced in mocking irony as the ship
goes down. Through it all runs a vein of poetic fancy, well suggesting
the beauty and mystery of the sea. The oratorio “Francesca da Rimini”
is another strong work, the best of Gilson’s productions in that form.</p>
<p><b>Lekeu</b>.—Guillaume Lekeu (Verviers, Belgium, 1870-1894) was a
composer whose early death cut short a career of great promise. His
chief studies were pursued in Paris, where he came under the elevating
influence of Franck. The subtle delicacy of his harmonic effects is a
result of this teaching, and Lekeu seems like a member of the French
school who strayed across the border by mistake. His early cantata
“Andromède,” and his Fantasie on popular Angevin airs, gained him some
notice. His works include two Symphonic Studies, an attractive “Poeme”
for violin and orchestra, and an exquisite Adagio for violin, ’cello,
and strings. His greatest vocal composition is the “Chant Lyrique,” for
chorus and orchestra, but he has produced many songs of lofty melodic
style. His music is marked by great originality and fertility of
invention, but tinged with a spirit of melancholy and gloom.</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—<b>Edgar Tinel</b> (Sinaai, Flanders, 1854)
is another pupil of the Brussels Conservatory, where he studied with
Fétis. His great work is the three-part oratorio “Franciscus,” treating
the story of St. Francis of Assisi. Other works are “Sainte Godelieve”
and the music to “Polyeucte.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Jan Blockx</b> (Antwerp, Belgium, 1851) is the most popular opera
composer of his country. His greatest success is the “Herbergprinses”
(Princess of the Inn), a work with a strong dramatic plot and music
of remarkable freshness and vigor. “Thyl Uylenspiegel,” in Blockx’s
opera of that name, is no longer the graceless rogue of the old German
story, but a popular hero who rescues Maestricht from the Spaniards.
Other operas of this composer are “The Bride of the Sea,” and “Maître
Martin,” an earlier work. Other composers prominent in the new movement
are Keurvels, Wambach, Mortelmans, Vleeshouwer, and Mathieu. The first
place among the women is occupied by Juliette Folville, the young
violinist, who has written the opera “Attala,” a march, parts of a
symphony, and many smaller works.</p>
<p><b>Music in Holland</b>.—<b>Richard Hol</b> was for many years the
Nestor of the Dutch composers. His fame was assured by the patriotic
hymn, “Comme je t’aime, O mon pays,” and his long career of activity
was of great service to the cause of music in Holland. He was a
prolific composer, and an excellent critic and journalist. <b>Julius
Roentgen</b>, who studied under Reinecke and Lachner, was better known
as pianist than as composer, but produced an excellent concerto, also
“Das Gebet,” for chorus and orchestra, and other works. The best of the
younger men are <b>Bernard Zweers</b> and <b>Alphonse Diepenbrock</b>,
while others deserving mention are Van t’Kruys, Gottfried Mann, Dirk
Schaefer, and the Brandt-Buys brothers. Among the women-composers,
Catherine van Rennes and Hendrika van Tussen-Broek have done
excellently in small forms, while Cornelia van Oosterzee attempts
ambitious orchestral work, and Cora Dopper has entered the field of
opera. Amsterdam has become a great musical centre, and Holland, no
less than Belgium, is reaping the result of the widespread educational movement.</p>

<h2>LESSON LV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">National Schools: Bohemia and Scandinavia</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Influence of Folk-Music</b>.—Some races are endowed with a
better musical taste than others. Among these favored peoples the
Folk-song, the music that appeals directly to the popular heart, needs
only the touch of a gifted composer to fashion it into a great national
school. In the case of England and Belgium, we have seen that even
the most thorough musical education cannot wholly atone for a lack of
real public taste in music. Scotland, possessing a wealth of beautiful
Folk-songs, has not yet given birth to a composer who can employ its
style in larger forms. But in Bohemia and the countries of Northern
Europe, the Folk-music has not only been worthy in itself, but has been
properly developed and amplified by gifted composers.</p>
<p><b>Smetana</b>.—František Škroup (1801-1862) composed many popular
Bohemian <i>Volkslieder</i>, and wrote the first national opera, but the
real founder of the Bohemian school was Bedřich, or Frederick,
Smetana (Leito mischl, Bohemia, 1824—Prague, 1884). Parental
opposition could not prevent his studying music, and we find him at
Prague, under Proksh, and, later on, taking lessons of Schumann. That
master recommended a course with Mendelssohn, but as the pupil was too
poor, he changed his advice and suggested a study of Bach. Smetana
became an ardent admirer of Liszt, at whose house his own career was
decided. Hearing Herbeck remark, while there, that the Czechs were
merely reproductive, he made a solemn resolution to devote his life to
the building up of a national school of music in Bohemia.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>
<p><b>His Works</b>.—While conductor at Gothenburg, Sweden, he produced
three worthy symphonic poems: “Richard III,” “Wallenstein’s Camp,”
and “Hakon Jarl.” On his return, he wrote “The Brandenburgers in
Bohemia,” the first of the eight operas that have made him so famous
in his native land. This was Wagnerian in style, and at once the
critics assailed him fiercely for trying to bring Bohemia under the
musical domination of Germany. To show that he could write in a more
popular vein, Smetana produced a second opera, “Prodaná Nevĕsta,” (The
Bartered Bride), which proved a marvel of musical grace and delicacy,
and was enough in itself to establish the reputation of any composer.
“Dalibor” is a dramatic work in serious vein, while “Libuše” is based
on a national subject. “The Two Widows” and “The Kiss” are light operas
of marked success, the latter being often cited as a perfect model
for this style. “The Secret” is in the same vein, while “The Devil’s
Wall” is again on a national legend. Other notable works are the string
quartet “Aus Meinem Leben,” and the “Carnival of Prague”; but Smetana’s
greatest orchestral work is the set of six symphonic poems entitled “Ma
Vlast” (My Fatherland). These depict “Vyšehrad,” a historic fortress;
“Vltava,” the river Moldau; “Sarka,” a mythical Amazon; “Bohemia’s
Groves and Meadows,” “Tabor,” the Hussite camp; and “Blanik,” the magic
mountain where the warriors sleep. Smetana’s music shows an inspiration
and depth of feeling that make him rank with the world’s great
composers, and his struggles against poverty and disease form a story
of the utmost pathos.</p>
<p><b>Dvořák</b>.—The greatest of Smetana’s pupils was <b>Antonin
Dvořák</b> (Mühlhausen, Bohemia, 1841—Prague, 1904). Son of a butcher,
he persuaded the village schoolmaster to give him lessons. He began
composition at Zlonitz, and soon sent home a polka to surprise his
family; and as he had written it without considering the transposing
instruments, thus causing three different keys to sound together, the
resulting discords certainly accomplished that purpose. After further
study at Prague, he was able to gain a Government pension, and to
interest such men as Hanslick and Brahms. He spent his time in “hard
study, occasional composition, much revision, a great deal of thinking,
and little eating.” Being asked what teacher helped him most, he
replied: “I studied with God, the birds, the trees, the rivers, myself.”

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
<b>His Works</b>.—Dvořák’s many operas, including “Wanda,” “Dimitri,”
“Armida,” and others, have been surpassed in importance by his
orchestral works. His “Stabat Mater” and the cantata “The Spectre’s
Bride” are important vocal compositions. His overtures include such
well-known examples as the “Husitzká,” “Mein Heim,” “Othello,” “In der
Natur,” and the “Carneval.” Other instrumental works are the famous
“Slavic Dances,” the Slavonic Rhapsodies, the “Scherzo Capriccioso,”
three Ballades, and a “Hero Song.” Before coming to New York, in 1892,
he had written four great symphonies; but the fifth, “Aus der Neuen
Welt,” is of the greatest interest to Americans, since Dvořák here
adopted the plantation style in his themes, to show what could be done
in building up an American school of music. He was eminently successful
in handling his material, and he produced a greater and more truly
national work than any resident composer has yet done. In general,
Dvořák’s style is more cosmopolitan than that of Smetana, and his
faculty of melodic invention makes his works attractive. He enriched
the symphony by two Bohemian dance-movements—the Dumka, and the Furiant.</p>
<p><b>Other Bohemians</b>.—<b>Zdĕnek Fibich</b>, though little known
outside of his own country, was another famous opera-composer. He
devoted some efforts to melodrama also, “Hippodamia” being his chief
work in this field. He published two symphonies and several symphonic
poems, the latter showing the influence of Liszt. <b>Reznícĕk</b>,
who has recently identified himself with the musical life of Germany,
has produced five operas, of which the sparkling comedy “Bonna Diana”
and the later “Till Eulenspiegel” are the best. <b>Josef Suk</b>,
son-in-law of Dvořák, has composed some attractive instrumental
music, while <b>Nápravník</b>, of an earlier generation, won operatic
successes in St. Petersburg. Hungary, too, has a national school of
opera, founded by <b>Franz Erkel</b>. This school is carried on by such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
men as Alexander Erkel, the Doppler brothers, Mihalovitch, Zichy, and
Hubay, while Dohnanyi is better known as pianist than as composer.
Poland is represented by <b>Paderewski</b>, while <b>Soltys</b> has won
renown in symphony, and <b>Stalkowsky</b> in opera.</p>
<p><b>Norwegian Music</b>.—Norway is preëminently a land of song. Its
sombre fiords, dark forests, and smiling meadows have at all times
inspired a school of Folk-music whose plaintive sweetness exerts the
utmost charm on the musical auditor. In <b>Edvard Hagerup Grieg</b>
(Bergen, 1843-1907) we find a composer of wonderful melodic gifts and
expressive power, who has preserved admirably the flavor of the local
Folk-songs and dances. Grieg owed much to the wise training of his
mother, a woman of rare gifts. At Ole Bull’s advice, he took a course
at Leipzig, after which he studied further with Gade, at Copenhagen.
There he met Rikard Noordraak, who first aroused his enthusiasm for the
songs and legends of his native land.</p>
<p><b>Grieg’s Works</b>.—Grieg’s genius was essentially lyric and
melodic, but this in no way detracts from the greatness of his
orchestral works. The “Autumn” overture is clear and beautiful, with
the simplicity of strength, not of weakness. The “Norwegian Dances”
mark the beginning of the national style that is carried out in
the melodrama “Bergliot,” the two “Peer Gynt” suites, and “Sigurd
Jorsalfer.” The piano concerto, somewhat in the style of Schumann, is
one of Grieg’s best works, and shows the utmost perfection of melodic
and harmonic architecture. The “Elegiac Melodies,” the “Norwegian
Themes,” and the “Holberg Suite,” all for strings, are further examples
of his rich fulness of romantic utterance. His choral and chamber
works show the same sympathetic treatment, while his piano works and
songs include some of the most exquisite gems in the entire musical
repertoire. His works show endless melodic invention, great power of
expression, and a warmth of tender sentiment that seems never to lose
its charm.</p>
<p><b>Christian Sinding</b> (Kongsberg, Norway, 1856) studied at Leipzig
also, and won a royal scholarship that took him to Munich and Berlin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
He belongs to an artistic family, for one brother, Otto, is a painter,
and another, Stefan, a sculptor. Sinding’s music is melodic in
character, and distinctively Norwegian in style, but less so than that
of Grieg. His orchestral works include an excellent symphony, brought
out under Weingartner and later by Thomas; an attractive concerto for
piano, and two for violin; a “Rondo Infinito”; and the interesting
suite, “Episodes Chevaleresques.” His chamber-music, violin sonatas,
piano solos, and songs are made of the most attractive material.</p>
<p><b>Other Norwegians</b>.—<b>Johann Severin Svendsen</b>, though
prominent in Danish music, is really Norwegian by birth. Son of a
military bandmaster, he soon obtained a position similar to his
father’s. But he longed for higher things, and after a tour as violin
virtuoso, he studied at Leipzig, under Reinecke. He traveled much,
meeting in Paris an American woman whom he afterwards married in her
own country. After some experience in Christiania, he became court
conductor in Copenhagen, where he owns the baton used by von Weber
and inscribed with that composer’s name. His orchestral works include
two symphonies, four Norwegian Rhapsodies, the legend “Zorahayde,”
and the “Carnival at Paris,” but they are too conventional to take
foremost rank. A prominent composer among the younger Norwegians is
<b>Ole Olsen</b>, of Hammerfest, whose symphonic poem “Asgardsreien”
is but one of his many successes. <b>Gerhard Schjelderup</b> is one of
the modern radicals, and shows all the complexity and dissonance of
Strauss. <b>Agathe Backer-Grohndahl</b> is the leader of the Norwegian
women-composers.</p>
<p><b>Music in Denmark</b>.—In Denmark, the fame of Gade obscured that
of other composers, and such a man as J. P. E. Hartmann could gain
scarcely more than local reputation. The most important name in recent
years is that of <b>August Enna</b>, who won a popular operatic triumph
in 1892 with “Die Hexe.” He was almost wholly self-taught, for poverty
prevented him from taking lessons, sometimes even from buying music
paper. “Cleopatra” is a later work, while “The Little Match-Girl” was
the beginning of a series of fairy operas. Enna handles his orchestra
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
with boldness and skill, and displays vocal fluency and thematic
excellence. <b>Eduard Lassen</b> gained more renown by his melodious
songs than by his operas or orchestral works. <b>Otto Malling</b> is
known for his piano pieces, while <b>Victor Bendix</b> has attempted
the symphonic poem. <b>Ludwig Schytté</b>, a friend of Liszt, has made
Berlin his home, and is identified with light opera as well as piano music.</p>
<p><b>Music in Sweden</b>.—The national opera of Sweden was brought
into being by <b>Ivar Hallstrom</b>, soon after the middle of the
19th century. Since then, a new school has arisen, showing the
influence of Liszt, Wagner, Schumann, and at times, Berlioz, with
the plaintive sweetness of the native Folk-music pervading it all.
<b>Anders Hallen</b>, the first of the new romanticists, has written
four operas (of which “Hexfallen” is the best), several symphonic
poems and Swedish Rhapsodies, a number of ambitious cantatas, and some
beautiful Swedish and German songs. He unites the charm of his native
music with strength of passion and richness of instrumentation. <b>Emil
Sjögren</b> shows a harmonic feeling worthy of Grieg, but his boldness
in modulation often produces bizarre effects. He excels in the smaller
forms, such as his “Spanish Songs,” “Tannhäuser Lieder,” and several
piano cycles. <b>Wilhelm Stenhammar</b>, pupil of these two, shows much
enthusiasm and spirit in his music, but his operas are now laid aside.
<b>Wilhelm Peterson-Berger</b> is the best of the new opera-composers,
his music-drama “Ran” being a recent success. <b>Hugo Alfven</b>
has attempted the symphony, with fair success. <b>Tor Aulin</b>, a
famous violinist, has produced concertos and other works for his
instrument, while <b>Erik Akerberg</b> has devoted his energy to choral
works. <b>Elfrida Andree</b> is the most prominent of the Swedish
women-composers.</p>
<p><b>Music in Finland</b>.—The national epic of Finland is the
<i>Kalevala</i>, a work of real poetic beauty. There is also a collection
of shorter lyrics, called the <i>Kanteletar</i>. These have furnished
inspiration for a large number of modern composers, of whom the most
important is <b>Jean Sibelius</b>. He studied with Becker in Berlin and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
Goldmark in Vienna. On his return to Helsingfors, the capital, he
became the leader of the new Finnish school. His two symphonies are
worthy if not absolutely great, but his symphonic poems, and the suite
“King Christian IV,” show real musical beauty. He has been active in
the smaller forms also, and holds the Government pension for musical
excellence. <b>Armas Jarnefelt</b> is another good orchestral composer,
while <b>Ernest Mielck</b>, who died at twenty-two, showed a lyric
beauty not unworthy of Schubert. <b>Richard Faltin</b> is one of the
older song-composers. <b>Martin Wegelius</b>, died 1906, did valuable
work as director of the Musical Institute, while <b>Robert Kajanus</b>
became prominent as the founder and leader of the Helsingfors
Philharmonic Orchestra. Both are excellent composers, the former
working chiefly in vocal forms, the latter in the orchestral field.</p>

<h2>LESSON LVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Russian School</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Folk-Music in Russia</b>.—The Slav nature differs greatly from that
of the races of Western Europe, and this difference appears also in the
Slavonic music. For a proper understanding of the Russian Folk-songs,
the student should be familiar with the country and its history, its
vast steppes, its lonely summers and dreary winters, and the patient
poverty of its long-suffering peasants. It is rich in legendary lore,
and the poetry of Pushkin and Gogol has wrought the wild beauty of
these tales into permanent form. The popular melodies trace their
origin back to pagan times, and show infinite variety. There are
epic chants, songs of weddings and funerals, and weirdly beautiful
cradle-songs, Their delicate, capricious rhythm, and their strangeness
of harmony and cadence, possess the utmost attraction. At times the
songs are strong and savage, at times tranquil and majestic, or brisk
and graceful; but usually they are tinged with the profound melancholy
of an oppressed race. The church music, too, with its old modes and
deep-voiced choirs, flourishes in unusual purity.</p>
<p><b>The Rise of Russian Music</b>.—In the middle of the 18th century,
the Imperial Court began to import foreign composers, and St.
Petersburg was enabled to hear and see such men as Paisiello, Cimarosa,
and Boieldieu. Works in the native language soon followed, and the
Venetian Cavos became so identified with Russian music that he might
almost have passed for a native. The first Russian composer, however,
was <b>Glinka</b>, whose “Life for the Czar” (1836) was received with
profound enthusiasm by the entire nation. Other composers followed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
best of whom were <b>Dargomishky</b> and <b>Seroff</b>. The former
died only recently, and his later works show the Wagnerian influence.
Instrumental music flourished also. The rich melodic beauty of
Rubinstein charmed all Europe, and only the passionate power of
Tchaikovsky placed it in the background. But now even he, the greatest
of the Russians, is not considered truly national by his countrymen,
who think him too German in style.</p>
<p><b>Balakireff</b>.—Of the five men who strove to make Russian
music distinctively national, <b>Mily Alexejevitch Balakireff</b>
(Nijni-Novgorod, Russia, 1836) was not the greatest, but may justly be
called the founder of the movement. After his university studies, he
came under the influence of Alexander Oulibicheff, a retired diplomat
who devoted himself to music. The young man soon settled in St.
Petersburg, where he met Cui, and began with him the work of developing
the new school. Balakireff has been active as pianist, teacher, and
concert leader. The musical principles adopted by him and his four
associates called for the use of Russian Folk-music in just the way
that Dvořák employed the plantation style in his “New World” symphony.
This idea is at least as old as the days of Weber, whose “Freischütz,”
written in the popular vein, made such an overwhelming triumph in
Germany. With the wealth of beautiful Folk-songs in Russia, it has been
possible to produce an immense amount of interesting music, with which
the Western world is as yet by no means fully acquainted. Balakireff
himself was not prolific as a composer, but his works, though few in
number, show real value. They include a symphony, three overtures
(Russian, Czech, and Spanish), incidental music to “King Lear,” the
symphonic poem “Russia,” and a second one, “Tamara,” based on the
legend of a beautiful Caucasian princess who entertained the passing
cavalier for a night, while in the morning the river Tarek bore away
his corpse. Another Oriental subject is the difficult piano fantasie
“Islamey.” His lesser works include mazurkas, some four-hand pieces,
and a score of remarkable songs, masterly in their perfection of detail.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
<b>César Antonovitch Cui</b> (Vilna, Russia, 1835) has been the
literary champion of the new school. Son of a French soldier, Cui
studied engineering, and became professor of fortification. In his
writings we may see that the new Russians seem unwilling to admit the
greatness of Wagner, but they have none the less adopted nearly all
his dramatic theories. Like him, they revolted against the inanities
of the old Italian opera, which was merely a singing-concert. They
admitted that after Beethoven and Schumann, the symphony could say
little of new import, but reform was needed in opera; the plot should
be worthy, and the music not only good in itself, but appropriate to
the sentiment. Yet Russian opera has not followed Wagner, but has
proceeded along its own lines; and Cui even writes: “I would like
to preserve my compatriots from the dangerous influence of Wagner’s
decadence. Whoever loves his music, ceases to appreciate real music;
whoever admires his operas, holds Glinka as a writer of vaudevilles.
The desire to find something deep where nothing exists can have only
dangerous consequences.” These strictures are not unlike certain early
German criticisms of Wagner, now happily forgotten. Cui’s own operas
include “The Prisoner of the Caucasus,” “William Ratcliff,” “Angelo,”
“Le Filibustier,” and “The Saracen,” but none has won any real success.
His music is good, but even his own countrymen admit that it lacks
novelty or individuality. “Angelo” is the composer’s favorite. He, too,
has done much in the smaller forms.</p>
<p><b>Moussorgsky</b>.—The strangest figure in the group of five was,
by all odds, <b>Modest Petrovitch Moussorgsky</b> (Karevo, Russia,
1839—St. Petersburg, 1881). Like Cui, he received a military training,
and became an officer, but his restiveness soon caused his resignation,
and two later attempts at Government work were again failures. His
fondness for drink, and his many excesses, soon marked him as a
Bohemian whose dominating passions and savage independence could brook
no restraint. The same qualities are shown in his music. He was a poet
by nature, expressing in great thoughts the passion and misery of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
humanity, but never taking the trouble to master the technic of his
art. Thus his two operas, “Boris Godunoff” and “Chovanstchina,” did
not meet with favor until smoothed and polished by his more learned
friends. The same is true of his “Night on Calvary” and “Intermezzo”
for orchestra. His “Defeat of Sennacherib” is one of many “Hebraic
Choruses,” while the “Tableaux d’une Exposition” are among the best of
his piano pieces. His songs include settings of Goethe and Heine, as
well as the Russian poets.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Porphyrievitch Borodin</b> (St. Petersburg, Russia,
1834-1887) could claim kinship with the old princes of Imeretia,
the former Caucasian kingdom whose rulers boasted of their descent
from King David. He studied medicine and surgery, and wrote several
important works on chemistry. He was active in the cause of higher
education for women, and founded a medical school for them. In music
he owed his development chiefly to Balakireff, though he composed at
an early age, almost by instinct. The success of his first symphony
encouraged him to write two others, as well as an orchestral scherzo.
His two string quartets are full of originality, and his choral and
piano music shows the same quality. He is best known in America by the
“Steppenskizze,” a tone-picture of the vast Russian plains traversed
by Oriental caravans. His greatest work, however, is the opera “Prince
Igor,” on an old Russian war-legend treated by Pushkin. Borodin is a
master of sombre effects, and his dissonances are at times almost too
striking; but there is real musical worth, also, in his compositions.</p>
<p><b>Rimsky-Korsakoff</b>.—The best of the renowned group of five is
decidedly <b>Nicolai Andreievitch Rimsky-Korsakoff</b> (Tikhvin,
Russia, 1844). He, too, adopted a vocation other than music, graduating
from a Government school and afterwards attaining the rank of admiral.
His chief musical work has been in opera, and his dozen productions in
this form are nearly all widely popular in his native land. “The Czar’s
Betrothed” is the best known, but the “May Night,” “The Snow Maiden,”
and “Sadko” are not far behind it in favor. “Mozart and Salieri” is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
one-act version of a poem by Pushkin, based on the suspicion that
Mozart was really poisoned by his Italian rival. In the orchestral
field, “Antar,” “Scheherezade,” and “Sadko” are three symphonic poems
that show remarkable mastery of expression. Other orchestral works
are an overture on popular melodies, another on church themes, a
“Serb Fantasie,” a “Spanish Caprice,” and a “Fairy Legend.” He has
written a noble and dignified concerto, dedicated to Liszt, and the
usual number of lesser works. He shows the greatest skill in handling
instrumental color, an art for which the Russians are noted. His
music is descriptive, dramatic. His inspiration never flags, and his
treatment of the thematic material is always interesting and skilful.
His music may perhaps be criticised as lacking unity, but its breadth
and originality are undoubted.</p>
<p><b>Glazounoff</b>.—Among men of a later generation, <b>Alexander
Constantinovitch Glazounoff</b> (St. Petersburg, Russia, 1865) is the
most prominent, and the only one who may dispute with Rimsky-Korsakoff,
his former teacher, the position of greatest of the living Russian
composers. Son of a rich bookseller, he was able to devote all his
energies to music, and produced at eighteen a symphony that won
the congratulations of Liszt. Since then he has composed works as
beautiful as they are numerous. His early creations show a tendency to
fantastic and imaginative subjects. The haunting beauty of the forest,
the inspiring charm of spring, the compelling magic of the sea, the
gorgeousness of the Orient, the majesty of the historic Kremlin, all
find an echo in his great orchestral rhapsodies. His seven symphonies
are marvels of harmonic richness and melodic beauty. His “Triumphal
March” for the Chicago Exposition, and a “Coronation Cantata” for the
Czar, were both written to order. His early overtures are based on
sacred themes, but the “Carnival” and the “Ouverture Solennelle” are
again in the style of vivid coloring to which he has accustomed his
hearers. His eighty or more published compositions include ballades,
marches, suites, mazurkas, and other numbers for orchestra, to say
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
nothing of chamber works, songs, cantatas, and two piano sonatas.
For a time, he renounced his early style, and wrote serious works in
classical German vein, but he returned to it with a number of ballets,
or pantomimes with real plot and full orchestral accompaniment.</p>
<p><b>Anton Stepanovitch Arensky</b> (Nijni-Novgorod, Russia, 1861-1906)
is another of a younger generation, and like Glazounoff, did not
limit himself to the style of Russian Folk-music, but aims to be more
cosmopolitan. Educated at St. Petersburg, Arensky soon became known by
a symphony and a piano concerto, and was called to Moscow as professor
of counterpoint. In that city he increased his reputation by a grand
opera, “A Dream on the Volga.” “Raphael,” a one-act work, was followed
by the ballet, “A Night in Egypt,” but Arensky’s greatest opera is “Nal
and Damajanti,” on an East Indian subject. His other works include
a second symphony, a fantasie with piano, a violin concerto, and a
“Memorial March.” He displays real strength of feeling, and he shows
the influence of Schumann and Tchaikovsky, especially in his piano
music.</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—<b>Taneieff</b>, one of those who held apart
from the national movement, has written a symphony, some string
quartets, and numerous choruses, but is best known by his “Oresteia,”
an orchestral trilogy based on the tragedies of Aeschylus. This is
a work of dignity and power, but at times lacking in inspiration.
<b>Rachmaninoff</b>, a pupil of Arensky, is one of the younger men
who won fame as a pianist and piano composer before attempting larger
works. His more ambitious compositions include two concertos, a
symphony, a symphonic poem, and the cantata “Spring,” also two operas
“The Bohemians” and “The Avaricious Knight.” Another piano composer
is <b>Stcherbatcheff</b>, a pupil of Liszt, who displays excessive
boldness in his effects, though his “Fairy Scenes” are charming in
style, and his “Fantasies Etudes” show the influence of Schumann.
<b>Liadoff</b> is another composer of piano works, such as the
“Arabesques” and the “Birioulki.” <b>Scriabine</b> is one of the more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
recent piano writers who has won his spurs in the symphonic field also.
<b>Pachulski</b>, too, has become known by his piano compositions.
<b>Wihtol</b> has done much valuable work in collecting the Lett
Folk-melodies. <b>Solovieff</b> has attempted opera, though not
with any remarkable success. <b>Ippolitoff-Ivanoff</b>, active in
the musical life of Moscow, has produced operas, suites, and the
set of lyric scenes, entitled “Asia.” <b>Michael Ivanoff</b> is
another opera composer, whose “Sabawa” has met with some favor.
Among many others worthy of mention, <b>Sokoloff</b> has written
chamber-works, <b>Alpheraki</b> is noted for his songs, <b>Antipoff</b>
and <b>Blumenfeld</b> have produced excellent piano music, while
<b>Rebikoff</b>, known for the same reason, has won new laurels with
his so-called mimodrame, “Genius and Death.”</p>
<p><b>Tchaikovsky</b>.—Although the new Russian school does not recognize
Peter Iljitsch Tchaikovsky as an exponent of national musical ideas and
although he represents a blending of Teutonic and Slavonic methods,
yet his music partakes of the latter, rather than of the former
temperament, and he is therefore included among the Russian composers
in this lesson. He was born May 7, 1840; at ten he went to St.
Petersburg. He was intended for the legal profession and was appointed
to a place in the Ministry of Justice when only nineteen years old.
Shortly after, he entered the harmony classes at the Conservatory,
resigned his Government position, and entered the musical profession.
In 1866 he became professor of harmony at the Moscow Conservatory;
in 1867, brought out his first symphony and his first opera. In 1877
he resigned his post at the Conservatory and gave himself up to
composition. In 1891 he visited the United States. He died, October 12,
1893, in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>His compositions include eight operas, six symphonies, eight overtures
and fantasias for orchestra, seven works for special occasions, eight
orchestral suites, three string quartets, a trio and sextet, three
concertos and two other pieces for piano and orchestra, three works for
violin and orchestra, and two for ’cello and orchestra, a large number
of piano pieces and vocal works.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>
<p>An English critic sums up Tchaikovsky’s orchestral works thus: <i>Good
points</i>, beauty of melody, brilliancy of workmanship, beauty of color;
<i>weak points</i>, undue pursuit of the morbid, extravagance of idea,
noisiness of orchestration.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>.—At the beginning of the 20th century, the chief
characteristic of music seems to be a development of national
schools. As already explained, in those countries that have worthy
Folk-music, composers find the material ready for them to fashion.
Such has been the case in Norway, Sweden, and Bohemia, as well as in
Russia. Countries that have not this advantage, such as England, the
Netherlands, or America, atone for it in part by study and education;
but this seldom produces great musical geniuses. Italy, where the
common people cared for nothing but the lighter style of tune, has
had to build anew, upon foreign foundations. France is making a brave
struggle after novelty, but seems to lack the needed inspiration;
while Germany, for the moment, seems content with mastering the modern
orchestra. The Russian school is today the most spontaneous, the least
artificial; and it cannot fail to grow in appreciation during the next few years.</p>

<h2>LESSON LVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Music in the United States</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>The Cavaliers and the Puritans</b>.—The English settlers who
came to this country and located at Jamestown, and their successors,
brought with them from their home the songs they sang there—gay
songs, cavalier songs, love-ditties and the countryside tunes; but
they left them at this, making no attempt to adapt them to their new
surroundings. Indeed, it was as much a matter of fashion to be able to
play or to sing some new ballad just brought from London as it was to
have the latest fashion in dress. The Cavaliers were not the people
to give a distinctive tone to music in their adopted home. The stern,
severe, religious atmosphere of the New England Colonies did more for
the beginnings of American music, although the first efforts were
unpromising enough, since the Puritans discountenanced all music except
that of Psalm tunes, which were probably sung in unison, since at that
time there could be little question of singing in parts. Owing probably
to a scarcity of hymn-books, it was customary to read the hymn line by
line, and to sing in alternation with the reading, a custom observed in
some sections of the United States even in the latter part of the 19th
century. It was inevitable that the more progressive among the clergy
and the people should demand better singing of the Psalms; and from
this came the first singing schools, the beginning of musical education
in the Colonies. A singing school is noted in Boston in 1717. As this
movement spread, choirs were organized, since those who had gained
some skill in singing and in reading from notes would naturally draw
together, at first informally, later in regular organizations. This
occurred as early as the middle of the 18th century.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Hymn-Tune Composers</b>.—The prominence given to the singing of
Psalms and hymns is doubtless due to the fact that the first composers
developed in the Colonies confined their efforts to the production of
hymn-tunes. The first to gain prominence was William Billings, born in
Boston in 1746, died there, 1800. He was a tanner by trade and was,
of course, self-taught. His efforts at harmonizing were rather crude,
as is to be expected, since he had but few models in composition.
He introduced a somewhat florid style, although without training in
counterpoint. Yet the critic can see in the work of the early composers
such as Billings, a rough vigor and a striving for a more distinctive
melodic and rhythmic character than is to be found in the tunes brought
over from England, showing traces of the forces already at work to
differentiate the American character from the English. Billings’ first
collection of tunes was published in 1770. Other composers of this
period were Oliver Holden, who wrote the widely-sung “Coronation,”
Andrew Law, Jacob Kimball, Daniel Read and Timothy Swan. The two other
important cities, Philadelphia and New York, had some musical activity
during the Colonial period. In 1741, Benjamin Franklin published a
collection of hymns, performances were given of operas, and concerts
for charitable purposes were organized, yet nothing in the way of
native composition developed.</p>
<p><b>Early Musical Organizations</b>.—A musical atmosphere is essential
to musical development and progress, and a musical atmosphere comes
only from organized effort in musical work. The first efforts in this
direction were vocal, following the same line of development as that
we observed in the history of music as a whole, namely: first, vocal
and choral music; secondly, instrumental and particularly orchestral.
The earliest important society of this kind was the Stoughton (Mass.)
Musical Society, which grew out of a singing class formed in that town,
by Billings, in 1774. This organization still exists. The most famous
and most significant body for musical development was the Handel and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
Haydn Society, still in existence, which was organized in Boston, in
1815, with a chorus of nearly one hundred voices. Boston had at this
time some well-trained musicians, and others came there from Europe in
later years, making it the centre of American musical life for years.</p>
<p><b>Lowell Mason</b>.—In 1826, a young man from the South, but born in
Massachusetts, came to Boston to begin a musical career, which formed
a link between the early singing school stage and the work of the
present day. This was Lowell Mason, who was born in 1792, but spent his
younger days in Savannah, Ga., where he studied music as an amateur.
As the fruit of his efforts in composition, he published a collection
of church music which was endorsed by the Handel and Haydn Society,
and proved very successful, encouraging him, some years later, to take
up music as a profession. He was essentially a man of the people among
whom he lived and by nature an efficient teacher, to which he added
a skill and training that ensured him the respect of those who came
under his instruction. He traveled over New England and parts of New
York State, holding musical conventions, and teaching the principles of
music to hundreds of singers and teachers from far and near. His work
thus closely touched the people, and in a day when music was not taught
in the public schools, contributed greatly to spread a love for and a
knowledge of vocal music. He died August 11, 1872.</p>
<p><b>Musical Instruments</b>.—When instrumental music began to receive
a share of public attention, a great step was taken toward development
of music in the United States. In cities like Boston, New York,
Philadelphia and some Southern homes, instruments of the spinet and
virginal type could be found in the 17th and 18th centuries. The flute
was a gentleman’s instrument in those days, following the English
custom. The violin also received some attention. (Thomas Jefferson was
very fond of this instrument.) Naturally, the first instruments were
brought from England, yet the record shows that John Harris, of Boston,
who had learned the trade in England, offered for sale spinets of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
own make, in 1769. Some church organs were built several years earlier.
The harpsichord and piano followed in due course of time, as we can
gather from advertisements and concert programs. There is controversy
as to the making of the first pianos in the United States. Both
Philadelphia and Boston seem to have had makers in a small way before
the beginning of the 19th century. The pioneer in this industry was
Jonas Chickering, who served his apprenticeship in Boston and started
in business on his own account, in 1823. The growth of interest in
music arising from the organization of choral societies and the labors
of Lowell Mason, and the musicians of foreign birth who came to this
country created a demand for music outside of that for the voice, organ
and piano, for many of these musicians had been players in orchestras
in Europe.</p>
<p><b>Early Orchestras</b>.—The first permanent body of orchestral
players, the Philharmonic Society, was formed in Boston. The chief
promoter was a German, named Graupner, who came to the city named, in
1798. He gathered round him a few professionals and some amateurs, so
that the nucleus of an orchestra existed before the Handel and Haydn
Society was formed. Graupner also kept a music store and printed music.
A large orchestra was established in 1840, which remained active for
nearly a decade. New York had an organization of instrumentalists
which was started about the same time as Graupner’s society in Boston,
but its real work in this line did not occur until 1842, when the
Philharmonic Society was founded, with a strength of from fifty to
sixty players. This society still exists. The strongest musical force
in Philadelphia was the Musical Fund Society, which came into existence
in 1820, one object of which was to spread musical knowledge in the
city. It built a hall, which still stands, and gave both vocal and
instrumental concerts. Beethoven’s first symphony was given there, as
early as 1821.</p>
<p><b>Permanent Orchestral Organizations</b>.—The credit for raising the
standard of orchestral work and of spreading a popular appreciation
of the classics in absolute music belongs to Theodore Thomas, born in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
Germany, in 1835, whose family came to this country in 1845. He became
a proficient violinist while still a boy. His first efforts in the
line of the higher music were in the domain of chamber-music; in these
concerts he was associated with Dr. William Mason and others. In 1864,
he began his work in the orchestral field, in New York, visiting other
cities with his men and spreading a knowledge of the works of the
masters. Mr. Thomas conducted a series of concerts in Philadelphia,
but finished his labors in Chicago, as the conductor of the Chicago
Orchestra, which was established for him. He died in 1905. Following
the increased interest in orchestral music in New York City, due to
the work of Thomas, the Boston musical public called for a higher
standard and a more skilled set of players than the successors of
the old Philharmonic Orchestra, the Germania and the Harvard Musical
Association, which had kept up the work in a creditable manner. The
outgrowth of this sentiment was the establishment of the celebrated
Boston Symphony Orchestra, which gave its first concerts in the fall of
1881, under the direction of Mr. Georg Henschel. The financial needs
of the organization were guaranteed by Mr. Henry L. Higginson. Mr.
Henschel was succeeded, in 1884, by Wilhelm Gericke, who was followed
five years later by Arthur Nikisch; in 1893, Mr. Emil Paur was made
director, to be succeeded in 1898 by Wilhelm Gericke, who is still
(1905) at the head of the organization. The work of the orchestras
mentioned stimulated music lovers in other cities and at the present
time, worthy rivals of the older bodies exist in Philadelphia, Mr.
Fritz Scheel, director, the New York Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Walter
Damrosch, director, and the Pittsburgh Orchestra, under the direction
of Mr. Emil Paur. Baltimore has a good orchestra in connection with
the Peabody Conservatory, Cincinnati has a permanent body with a
guarantee fund, under the conductorship of Mr. Frank Van der Stucken.
The orchestras mentioned give concerts in other cities, so that their
work has more than a local significance. Other cities in which efforts
are being made to develop orchestral music are New Haven, Buffalo,
Washington, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco,
Los Angeles and Denver.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Other Organized Bodies</b>.—Other means for promoting musical
progress in the United States were the societies in different parts of
the country, which provided concerts, aided musical education, kept up
public interest, the great German singing societies, music festival
associations, lecture courses, etc. A prominent example of this kind
was the Musical Fund Society of Philadelphia which, among its other
activities, opened a music school that remained in existence for six
years. The Harvard Musical Association, an organization of alumni who
labored particularly for the advancement of music, formed the nucleus
of a musical library and conducted orchestral concerts at its own
expense or guarantee. In later years Pittsburgh had an active society
to promote musical appreciation and the example is being followed by
other cities. The greatest growth in this line, that of the formation
of music festival associations and the development of the idea, was
doubtless stimulated by the great festivals held in Boston in 1869
and 1872. Of these, the most important is the one held in Cincinnati,
for a number of years under the direction of Theodore Thomas; after
his death, under Mr. Van der Stucken. It is impossible to give here a
list of such organizations; they are growing in numbers over all the
country and form a hopeful sign of an increasing and healthy interest
in music. In addition to the work of these societies must be mentioned
the series of chamber-music concerts given by quartet organizations in
all the important cities, a kind of music which demands a higher class
of musical culture than any other and which is, therefore, a good index
of the musical appreciation of a community. The great public libraries
have collections of musical literature, as well as the printed works of
the great masters. Notable among these is the Brown Collection, in the
Boston Public Library; the Newberry Library of Chicago has a very fine
collection of musical literature, including many rare works, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
new public library in New York City will also have works of great value
to musicians. The Crosby-Brown Collection of musical instruments in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, is one of the most valuable
in the world; another collection of note is that which belongs to the
University of Michigan.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Folk-Music</b>.—In a study of conditions connected with the
development of music in the United States, we will not find the wealth
of material in the direction of Folk-music that European countries
possess. The American people being a composite one cannot have a true
Folk-music as yet. There are but two types of music that can be classed
in this category, the music of the Indians and that of the negro in
his plantation life. The characteristics of both have been used by
American composers in large works (Edward Mac Dowell: “Indian Suite,”
for the orchestra; Frederic Burton, in a choral work), yet the Indian
race forms no part of the dominant Caucasian people of the United
States and can hardly have any claims to being considered American
Folk-song. Among the negroes of the South, during the time of slavery,
a type of song developed that possesses distinctive qualities, and is
thoroughly pervaded with the emotional quality which characterizes the
Folk-song of the musical races of Europe. It is not the song of the
African in his native land, but the product of his new environment.
Particularly is this the case with regard to the songs in which the
religious element is the leading one. Many of them have the spontaneous
character of the old minstrel poets, the leader improvising the
verses, the chorus joining in the refrain. Several composers have used
material based on negro musical idioms, notably Antonin Dvořák, in his
“From the New World” symphony and G. W. Chadwick, in the scherzo of
one of his symphonies, but the most famous examples of the Folk-song
of the plantation type are found in the works of Stephen C. Foster
(1826-1864), the one most widely-known being “The Old Folks at Home”
or “Suwanee River,” incomparable in its sweet melancholy and tender
pathos, yet of extreme simplicity in harmonic basis and diatonic progressions.</p>
<p><b>The Opera</b>.—The development of the opera in the United States
is a story of change from the simple style of the English ballad opera
to the elaborate music dramas of Richard Wagner, in the North, with
New York City as the leading centre, while New Orleans, in the South,
with its large French population, furnishes a home for the French and
Italian school of opera. The “Beggar’s Opera,” by Gay, which had won
extraordinary popularity in England, was given in New York, in 1750,
and as early as 1791 New Orleans had a company of French singers.
Philadelphia also had performances before the end of the 18th century.
It was not until after the wars with England, when the country was
growing and becoming prosperous, that foreign managers and singers
considered it an inviting field. The first company of real artistic
worth was brought here in 1825, headed by Manuel Garcia, which included
his daughter, afterward Mme. Malibran. In 1832, the poet Da Ponte,
librettist of Mozart’s opera “Don Giovanni,” who was a resident of New
York City, brought another strong company of singers to the United
States. From that time on, for a number of years, opera was furnished
by visiting companies of foreign singers, who gave performances in
the leading cities of the country, New Orleans being the first to
establish a permanent opera season with a resident company. It was in
1859 that Adelina Patti made her first appearance, in New York City. In
1878, Mapleson, the impresario, commenced the “all star” system that
developed a taste for opera by giving the American public the chance to
hear the best singers in the world, and set a standard which has made
the people dissatisfied with a company well-balanced but lacking in
great singers. More real work is done to develop a community by hearing
a number of performances well done than one or two in a sensational
style. In 1883, the Metropolitan Opera House, in New York City, was
opened with a “star” company, managed by Henry E. Abbey. German opera
(Wagner music dramas) gained a foothold in this country through the
efforts of Dr. Leopold Damrosch, who directed the first artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
performance of Wagner’s Tannhäuser, in 1884, in the Metropolitan Opera
House; from this time, operas of the three great schools were given
here, Italian, French and German. The following year, Anton Seidl was
called to the conductorship and his labors put the performances of
Wagner’s operas on a plane equal to any in the world; the company had
seasons in the other leading American cities. After Seidl’s death, in
1898, the performances continued along the same lines and with the
same high artistic quality, the greatest singers being engaged. In
1903, on Christmas Eve, under the direction of Mr. H. Conried, the
first American representation (and the first outside of Bayreuth) of
“Parsifal” was given. In assigning credit for work of an educational
character in opera, mention must be made of certain traveling
companies, such as the “Ideals” and “Bostonians” who gave highly
artistic performances of the standard operas, and of the companies
under the direction of Mr. Henry W. Savage, who gave grand opera in
English during the first decade of the present century.</p>

<h2>LESSON LVIII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">American Composers: Works in Large Instrumental Forms</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>American Music Still Young</b>.—Musical composition in the United
States is still too young in comparison with the work of European
composers to have made marked impress on history. American composers
owe their training largely to European teachers, the models upon which
they have based their work come from European art, and the principles
of construction were developed by the European masters. Hence the
disposition to view American composition as still in a state of
pupilage. Yet the record shows a number of men who have done worthy
work, many of them winning far more than a local reputation, and not
a few enjoying international fame. And this work, especially such as
is cast in the large forms, for orchestra, chamber-music or chorus
with orchestra, is the product of the years since the close of the
Civil War, a very short period, indeed, when compared with the story
of composition in most of the European countries. It speaks volumes
for the native capacity and sturdy industry of American composers that
they have, in less than a half-century, won a high place in the use
of the materials of musical composition and that they have so readily
assimilated the work and teachings of European masters.</p>
<p><b>Paine</b>.—The earliest composer in large instrumental forms was
John K. Paine, born, Portland, Me., 1834, died 1906. In 1858, he went
to Germany to study and gave particular attention to the organ. He
quickly gained rank as the chief American organist, on his return to
the United States, several years later. In 1862, he became connected
with Harvard University as an instructor in music, a full professorship
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
being created in 1875. His first important works were choral, with
orchestral accompaniment. His first symphony was brought out in 1876,
his second, called “Spring,” in 1880. Other large works for orchestra
are a symphonic fantasy based on Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” a symphonic
poem “An Island Fantasy,” the inspiration of which came from several
paintings of marine scenes, and an overture to Shakespeare’s “As
You Like It.” Prof. Paine’s large choral works are: a Mass in D, an
oratorio “St. Peter,” music to “Œdipus Tyrannus,” “Phœbus,
Arise,” “Nativity,” drawn from Milton, “Song of Promise,” hymns for the
Centennial and Columbus Exhibitions, music to Aristophanes’ “Birds,”
an opera “Azara,” besides organ compositions, chamber-music, songs and
part-songs.</p>
<p><b>Gilchrist</b>.—A composer whose training was entirely American
is William W. Gilchrist, born in Jersey City, in 1846, a resident
of Philadelphia for many years, where his professional activity has
included important work as teacher of singing, and chorus conducting.
His musical education was received mainly from Dr. H. A. Clarke, of
the University of Pennsylvania. His compositions include a symphony, a
suite for orchestra and a great deal of chamber-music. He has written
a number of works for chorus with orchestra, his most notable being a
setting of the Forty-sixth Psalm, to which was awarded a $1000 prize,
offered by the Cincinnati Festival Association. His other compositions
include choral works in smaller forms, with string or other
accompaniment suited to chamber-music, part-songs, church music, and
a number of fine songs. He is especially happy in writing for women’s voices.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
<b>Chadwick</b>.—A composer who has won appreciation in Europe
is George W. Chadwick, born in Lowell, Mass., in 1854. His studies
were carried on in the New England Conservatory, at Boston, which
institution he entered in 1872. Five years later he went to Leipzig to
study, giving special attention to composition. In 1879, he went to
Dresden to study with Rheinberger. In 1880, he returned to the United
States and settled in Boston. His professional activities included work
as organist, conductor, and teacher at the New England Conservatory.
In 1897, he was called to the directorship of the Conservatory. His
compositions are written in all the various forms, his reputation as
a composer of high rank being based upon his large orchestral works,
which include three symphonies, four overtures, chamber-music, a comic
opera, a sacred opera, “Judith,” two cantatas, popular with choral
societies, “Phœnix Expirans” and the “Lily Nymph,” a ballad for
chorus and orchestra, “Lovely Rosabelle,” part-songs, church music, and
a number of songs of high merit.</p>
<p><b>MacDowell</b>.—An American composer in thorough accord with the
modern musical tendencies in composition is Edward Alexander MacDowell,
born in New York, in 1861. His most famous teacher was Mme. Teresa
Carreño, the celebrated pianist. He became a pupil of the Paris
<i>Conservatoire</i>, in 1876, and after three years under French masters
and influences, went to Germany, where he studied under Ehlert, Heymann
and Raff, the latter giving him a thorough grounding in the technic of
composition. His musical education, therefore, included both French
and German ideas. He remained in Germany as pianist, composer and
teacher until 1888, when he returned to the United States and settled
in Boston. In 1896, he accepted the position of professor of music in
Columbia University, New York City, which he held until 1904, when he
resigned to devote himself to composition exclusively. MacDowell was
trained to a thorough understanding of form, yet his works show that
he regards only the spirit of form, that he is its master and not its
servant. He has plenty of force, vigor and originality of melody and
rhythm and is resourceful in his command of modern harmony. Critics of
high authority have unhesitatingly awarded him the highest rank among
American-born composers. His compositions include works in the large
forms, two concertos, two suites, four poems for orchestra, four piano
sonatas of striking romantic content, a number of smaller works for the
piano, studies, songs and part-songs, principally for male voices.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Horatio Parker</b>.—It is significant of the advance in music over
other sections of the United States that New England should have been
the birthplace of a number of composers of reputation. Besides Paine
and Chadwick, two others have achieved eminence in the large forms:
Horatio Parker and Arthur Foote. Mr. Parker was born near Boston,
in 1863; his father was an architect, his mother a woman of fine
literary and musical culture. His first lessons in music, piano and
organ, were received from his mother, and such was his interest that
he made attempts at composition. At sixteen, he was appointed to a
position as organist and was thus launched into musical life. He kept
up his studies with Boston teachers, in composition with Chadwick, and
afterwards with Rheinberger, in Germany, in which country he remained
until 1885. His first appointment was director of music at Garden City
Cathedral Schools, Long Island, afterwards filling organ positions in
New York City, the most notable one being at the Church of the Holy
Trinity. He also taught in the National Conservatory. In 1893, he went
to Boston as organist and director of music at Trinity Church, and
in 1894, to Yale University, as professor of music. In addition to
the work in composition and history of music, Mr. Parker conducts a
series of orchestral concerts given by an orchestra supported by the
University. Mr. Parker’s compositions in large form include a symphony,
several overtures, a concerto for organ and orchestra, chamber-music,
cantatas for chorus and orchestra, and in smaller forms, piano and
organ pieces, songs and many part-songs. His cantata “Hora Novissima”
is one of the best works in this style produced by an American
composer, and has been given in England with success. The legend of
“St. Christopher” furnished material for a work of a secular character
that has been taken up by some important choral organizations.</p>
<p><b>Arthur Foote</b> was born at Salem, Mass., in 1854. His musical
education was wholly acquired in Boston, his leading teachers having
been Stephen A. Emery and B. J. Lang. Mr. Foote is also a graduate of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
Harvard University. His home is in Boston, where his professional
work is that of an organist, and teacher of piano and composition.
His most important work in large form is a suite for orchestra, Op.
36; in addition to this he has written successfully in the domain of
chamber-music, works for string orchestra, a quartet, a quintet, a trio
and a sonata for piano and violin; he has also written excellent works
for chorus with orchestra, “Wreck of the Hesperus,” piano and organ
pieces, a number of fine songs and part-songs. He is perhaps at his
best in writing for male voices, notable works being “The Skeleton in
Armor” and “Farewell to Hiawatha.”</p>
<p><b>Hadley</b>.—A younger composer than those mentioned, whose work in
the large forms has received commendation, is Henry K. Hadley, born
at Somerville, Mass., in 1871. His father was a member of the musical
profession, and first taught his son, who later went to Boston to study
with Emery, Chadwick and Allen (violin). In 1894, he went to Vienna
to study and wrote several works for orchestra while there. In 1896,
he returned to the United States and taught in St. Paul’s School, at
Garden City. He has written several symphonies, suites, an overture,
a cantata and a number of songs; two comic operas are also among his
works. He has won the Paderewski Prize for composition.</p>
<p><b>Frank van der Stucken</b>, born in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1858,
of Belgian descent, was educated abroad, mainly under Benoit, at
Antwerp, and entered professional life in Europe, yet he is classed
with American composers, for he has spent a great part of his active
musical life in this country. It was in 1884, that he came to New
York City as conductor of a large German singing society, at the same
time giving much attention to conducting orchestral works, in which
branch he had had considerable experience in Europe. In 1895, he went
to Cincinnati as conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of that city and
two years later, was dean of the College of Music, from the active
management of which he retired in 1903. Although he has written a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
number of orchestral pieces, his most important work, modern in form
and scored for the full modern orchestra is “William Ratcliffe,” a
symphonic prologue, which has a very dramatic program. He has also
written songs that are in the extreme style of the most advanced composition.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Beach</b>.—Few women have won any success in composition in
the large musical forms. A most notable exception is Mrs. H. H. A.
Beach (Amy Marcy Cheney), who was born at Henniker, N. H., in 1867.
She showed marked inclination for music while still a child and was
given regular instruction when only six years old. Soon after this her
parents moved to Boston and she continued her musical education there
under Ernst Perabo and Carl Baermann. Her studies in composition were
largely made without teachers, guided principally by the most thorough
and extensive study of the scores of the masters. She was married in
1885 to a prominent Boston physician. Mrs. Beach’s most important works
are her “Gaelic” symphony, a mass for chorus with organ and small
orchestra, a sonata for violin and piano and a piano concerto. In
addition to this she has written a number of piano pieces and songs.</p>
<p><b>Loeffler</b>.—An account of music in the United States would not be
complete without reference to the work of Mr. Charles M. Loeffler, one
of the most important figures in modern musical composition. Although
he was born in Europe (1861) and educated there, he has spent his
adult life in this country, having been for many years a violinist in
the Boston Symphony Orchestra. His best-known work is the “Death of
Tintagiles,” founded upon Maeterlinck. Rollinat and Verlaine have also
furnished inspiration to him. A concerted work for violin and orchestra
shows his skill both as composer and violinist. Of late years, Mr.
Loeffler has turned his attention to song composition.</p>
<p><b>Other Composers</b>.—In a concise account of the work of American
composers, short mention only can be given to a number of men who have
worked earnestly in composition, a field in which appreciation seems to
be granted freely to the foreigner but grudgingly to the compatriot.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
Conditions are not favorable to development along the lines of
public performance of works in large forms, orchestras are under the
control of foreign conductors, most of the players are foreigners,
and the concert-going public gives but scant attention to works by
an American. Therefore much credit is due to those who have worked
quietly and with but little hope of hearing their works, doing their
best to produce music in accord with the best canons of the art. Such
men are <b>Frederick Grant Gleason</b>, born at Middletown, Conn.,
1848 (died in Chicago, 1903), studied at home and abroad; <b>Adolph
M. Foerster</b>, born in Pittsburgh, Pa., 1854, who was educated
in Germany, and is now a resident of his native city; <b>Ernest R.
Kroeger</b>, born at St. Louis, 1862, educated at home, and still a
resident of the city of his birth; <b>Henry Schoenefeld</b>, born at
Milwaukee, 1857, educated at home and abroad; <b>Henry Holden Huss</b>,
born in Newark, N. J., in 1862, studied in New York and at Munich,
under Rheinberger, now a resident of New York City; <b>Arthur B.
Whiting</b>, born in Cambridge, Mass., 1861, educated in Boston and by
Rheinberger, at Munich, a resident of Boston; <b>Louis A. Coerne</b>,
professor of music at Smith College, who was educated in Boston and
Munich (Rheinberger); and <b>Harry Rowe Shelley</b>, of New York City,
who was born at New Haven, Conn., 1858, studied there and in New York
(Buck and Dvořák). These composers have by no means confined their work
to compositions for orchestra, chamber-music, cantatas, etc., but have
also written useful piano and organ pieces, and in a number of cases,
songs that have become extremely popular.

<h2>LESSON LIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">American Composers: Vocal Forms; Piano and</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Organ.—Musical Literature</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Cantata Composers</b>.—A number of American composers have turned
their attention to composition in opera and cantata forms. Some of
the composers already mentioned have written works of this character.
The first of American composers to work in the field of the cantata
was <b>J. C. D. Parker</b>, born in Boston, in 1828, a graduate of
Harvard, and a teacher with many years of splendid work to his credit.
His musical education was received at Leipzig. In 1854, he located in
Boston and took up a varied career as organist, conductor, and teacher
of piano and harmony, at the New England Conservatory. His large works
include a cantata, “Redemption Hymn,” a secular cantata, “The Blind
King,” and two works in oratorio form “St. John” and “The Life of Man,”
the latter showing him at his strongest. <b>Dudley Buck</b>, organist,
composer and teacher, is also one of the veterans of American music. He
was born at Hartford, Conn., in 1839, attended Trinity College several
years, began his musical instruction at sixteen years of age, went
to Germany several years later, giving his attention principally to
the organ and composition. In 1862, he returned to the United States,
worked professionally in Hartford, Chicago, and Boston; in 1874, he
went to New York, later to one of the leading churches of Brooklyn,
which position he retained until 1905. His choral works in large form
are “Don Munio,” “The Voyage of Columbus,” “The Golden Legend,” and the
“Light of Asia,” his largest and most important work, which has been
given in England. He has written many works for church use, much organ
music, songs and concerted vocal music, especially for male voices.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Opera</b>.—In opera we note the work of <b>Paine</b> (“Azara”);
<b>Chadwick</b> (“Judith,” a sacred opera); <b>Walter Damrosch</b>,
composer and conductor, born in Germany, in 1862, but a resident of the
United States in childhood, and hence identified with music in this
country, who has written a work of serious character to a libretto
founded on Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter”; <b>Reginald de Koven</b>,
born at Middletown, Conn., in 1859, with a list of several successful
light operas to his credit, as well as many songs which have had wide
appreciation; <b>Edgar Stillman Kelley</b>, born at Sparta, Wisconsin,
in 1857, educated in Chicago and Germany, a resident of San Francisco
for a number of years, where he brought out several notable works of a
popular character for the stage as well as the orchestra, employing in
the latter Chinese musical idioms with success in a humorous direction.
A composer whose work in light opera has had much success is <b>Victor
Herbert</b>, born in Dublin, Ireland. His professional career has been
largely spent in this country, his work as conductor of the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra being notable.</p>
<p><b>Song Composition</b>.—In the field of song composition, American
composers have done very good work. The American seems to turn
naturally to song and few of the most prominent of the native composers
have neglected this field, as will have been noticed in previous
paragraphs. Among those who have won high reputation in this line we
note <b>George L. Osgood</b>, of Boston, born in 1844, composer, singer
and teacher; <b>Frank Lynes</b>, of Boston, born in 1858, who has
also written good concerted vocal music and piano pieces; <b>Clayton
Johns</b>, born in Delaware, in 1857, but a resident of Boston during
the greater part of his professional career, with a long list of
part-songs and some piano pieces to his credit; and <b>Ethelbert
Nevin</b>, born near Pittsburgh, in 1862, educated in the United States
and in Europe, whose songs have a truly poetic character joined to
music of a high order; a number of his piano pieces have also been most
favorably received. He died in 1901.

<b>Piano Composition</b>.—The dean of American teachers of the piano
and of composers for that instrument is <b>William Mason</b>, born in
Boston, in 1829, a son of Lowell Mason, who studied at home and abroad
and spent two years with Liszt at Weimar. It was in 1854 that he came
back to the United States and located in New York City. In addition
to his works for the piano, some of which have been widely played,
he is the author of an important technical work, which stamps him as
an educator of originality and strength. A composer who is generally
classed as American, although his ancestry, education and environment
incline strongly to the French, is <b>Louis Moreau Gottschalk</b>,
born in New Orleans, in 1829. He early showed marked inclination for
music and was sent to Paris to study. His first reputation was won as
pianist. He traveled over Europe, the United States and parts of South
America, giving concerts, in which he gave the principal place to his
own compositions. He died in Brazil, in 1869. In later years, American
composers for the piano have not done such distinctive work as the
two writers just mentioned, yet the names of <b>Charles Dennee</b>
(1863), <b>Wilson G. Smith</b> (1855), <b>James H. Rogers</b> (1857),
and <b>William H. Sherwood</b> (1854), composer, pianist and teacher,
whose work in the educational field is most important; <b>Edward Baxter
Perry</b> (1855), who has splendidly triumphed over the infirmity
of blindness, and through his unique lecture recitals has been a
strong factor in musical progress in the United States; and several
men of foreign birth who have identified themselves with American
musical education: <b>Rafael Joseffy</b>, in New York City, <b>Carl
Baermann</b> and <b>Carl Faelten</b> in Boston, <b>Constantin von
Sternberg</b> in Philadelphia, and <b>Emil Liebling</b> in Chicago. Two
other names should be mentioned here, <b>Henry Schradieck</b>, of New
York, whose influence as a violinist and teacher has been great, and
<b>F. L. Ritter</b>, who occupied the chair of music in Vassar College,
a pioneer in college musical work.</p>
<p><b>Organ Composition</b>.—Nearly all of the best-known American
composers have been organists, yet certain men have made that line of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
musical work peculiarly their own. Such men are <b>B. J. Lang</b>
(1837), of Boston, organist, conductor and teacher; <b>George E.
Whiting</b> (1842), who in addition to his high rank as an organist and
teacher, has written most acceptably for his instrument, and also for
the orchestra and in the large choral forms; <b>George W. Warren</b>
(1828), and <b>S. P. Warren</b> (1841), whose sphere of activity is
identified with New York City; <b>E. M. Bowman</b> (1848), organist,
conductor, pianist and teacher; <b>Samuel B. Whitney</b> (1842),
organist, noted for his work in training boy choirs, also his musical
compositions for the Episcopal Church service; <b>Clarence Eddy</b>
(1851), organ virtuoso with an international reputation; <b>Henry M.
Dunham</b> (1853), who has written well for his instrument and has
had an active and useful career as a teacher. Among the younger men
of prominence as American organists who have put themselves abreast
with modern progress, and have studied all schools, may be mentioned
<b>Everett E. Truette</b>, <b>Wallace Goodrich</b>, <b>Wm. C. Carl</b>,
<b>Gerrit Smith</b>, <b>Charles Galloway</b>, <b>J. Fred Wolle</b>, who
organized the Bach Festival at Bethlehem, Pa., <b>H. J. Stewart</b>, a
representative California organist.</p>
<p><b>Musical Criticism</b>.—When indicating the various agencies for the
shaping of musical appreciation in the United States, special mention
must be made of a group of writers whose contributions to musical
magazines, to the daily press in the large music centres, as well as
their work in permanent form have influenced the taste of the American
public to a degree not paralleled in any other country. These writers
have enjoyed unusual opportunities and have used them well. The leading
newspapers of the United States give much space to reports of musical
events and have called to their aid writers of keen insight into
musical matters, thorough equipment on the score of musical knowledge,
and gifted with much skill in expression as well as mastery of literary
style.</p>
<p><b>The Older Critics</b>.—The first of these critics to claim our
attention is <b>John S. Dwight</b>, born in Boston, in 1813, a graduate
of Harvard, and a student of theology as well. Gifted with a sound
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
taste in art matters, his reviews of musical works, concerts, etc.,
were very useful and helpful and much appreciated by the best circles
of the city, for his associations were with the most famous literary
and scientific men of his day. In 1852, he established a musical
paper, <i>Journal of Music</i>, which lasted nearly thirty years. He died
in 1893. Another of the older writers is <b>George P. Upton</b>,
born in Boston, in 1834, a graduate of Brown University, who entered
journalism at twenty-one, as a member of the staff of the Chicago
<i>Journal</i>; after some years of service with that paper, he went to the
<i>Tribune</i>, with which he has ever since been associated. Mr. Upton’s
critical work covers the period of the growth of Chicago, which has
been phenomenal in art as well as in commercial directions, and has
been a most valuable factor in musical upbuilding. In recent years his
pen was a great aid to Theodore Thomas in his efforts to establish the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra. His works in permanent form are “Woman
in Music,” a series of books descriptive of the principal oratorios,
operas, cantatas, and symphonies, translations from the German of
Nohl’s biographies of musicians, and a “Life of Theodore Thomas.”
Coincident with Mr. Upton’s work in the West is that of <b>W. S. B.
Mathews</b>, born in London, N. H., in 1837. He was educated in Boston;
after some years of musical work in the South, he located in Chicago,
as organist, teacher, writer on musical matters. His reviews on local
musical affairs appeared in several of the leading dailies, he was a
contributor to Dwight’s <i>Journal</i>, and to all the musical papers that
have come into the field since. Perhaps no contemporary writer on
education in music has influenced, and so strongly, as many teachers
and students of music as Mr. Mathews. He has written a “Popular History
of Music,” “Hundred Years of Music in America,” “How to Understand
Music,” “Primer of Musical Forms,” and several works on the great
composers, with critical studies of their works.

<b>Boston Writers</b>.—The three leading Boston writers of recent
years are Louis C. Elson, Wm. F. Apthorp and Philip Hale. <b>Louis C.
Elson</b> was born in Boston, in 1848. He was educated for the musical
profession, at home and at Leipzig. In 1880, he became connected with
the New England Conservatory, and at the present time is head of the
theory department of that institution. His journalistic activity covers
a period of about thirty years and his writings have appeared in Boston
and New York papers, as well as in the leading musical journals. His
works in book form are ten in number, the most valuable to the student
of history being a large volume on the “History of American Music.”
The other works are critical, technical, and biographical. <b>Wm.
F. Apthorp</b> was born in Boston, in 1848, graduated at Harvard,
and began his critical work in music in 1872, being connected with
several Boston papers. Mr. Apthorp’s published works are few in number,
“Musicians and Music Lovers” and “The Opera, Past and Present.” In
addition to this he supplied program material for the Boston Symphony
Concerts for a number of years, educational as well as descriptive
and critical. <b>Philip Hale</b> was born at Norwich, Vt., in 1854,
graduated from Yale and was admitted to the Bar in New York in 1880.
His interest in music and musical work proved too strong for him and
he went abroad to Germany and France to study. In 1889, he located in
Boston and began work as musical critic on the staff of several of
the papers. For a number of years he was Boston correspondent for the
<i>Musical Courier</i> of New York. Two other men whose work in musical
literature has been significant are <b>Alexander W. Thayer</b>, born at
Natick, Mass., in 1817, who wrote the standard biography of Beethoven,
and <b>Thomas Tapper</b>, of Boston, who has written a number of
valuable educational works in music.</p>
<p><b>New York Critics</b>.—New York City has four men of the first
rank as writers on music, not only for critical acumen and technical
knowledge, but also for literary style. <b>Henry T. Finck</b> was born
in Missouri, in 1854, graduated from Harvard University, and studied
at German universities for three years. When he returned to the United
States he joined the editorial staff of the <i>Evening Post</i> and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
<i>Nation</i>, which places he still holds. His works in musical literature
are “Wagner and His Works,” “Paderewski and His Art,” “Songs and Song
Writers,” and “Chopin and Other Essays.” <b>Henry E. Krehbiel</b> was
born at Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1854. His first newspaper experience was
in Cincinnati; later he went to New York to the <i>Tribune</i>, which place
he still holds. His contributions to musical literature are “Studies in
the Wagnerian Drama,” “How to Listen to Music,” and “Music and Manners
in the Classical Period,” besides contributions to the leading musical
papers and general magazines. <b>William J. Henderson</b> was born at
Newark, N. J., in 1855, graduated from Princeton University, afterward
entering journalism in New York City, being connected with the <i>Times</i>,
and later with the <i>Sun</i>. His books are distinctly educational in tone:
“The Story of Music,” “How Music Developed,” “What is Good Music,”
“The Orchestra and Orchestral Music,” “Richard Wagner: His Life and
Dramas,” and “The Art of the Singer.” A writer on music who has made a
fine reputation in literary and dramatic criticism as well is <b>James
Huneker</b>, a native of Philadelphia, whose active work has been done
in New York City. His books of interest to the musician are a “Life
of Chopin,” “Mezzotints in Modern Music,” “Melomaniacs,” “Overtones,”
“Iconoclasts” and “Visionaries.”</p>
<p><b>Other Writers</b> in this field whose work deserves mention are
<b>Edward Dickinson</b>, of Oberlin, O., with two works, “History
of Music in the Western Church” and “The Study of the History of
Music”; <b>Philip Goepp</b>, of Philadelphia, “Symphonies and their
Meanings”; <b>Daniel Gregory Mason</b>, of Boston, “From Grieg to
Brahms”; <b>Lawrence Gilman</b>, of New York, “Phases of Modern Music”;
Professor <b>Hugh A. Clarke</b>, of the University of Pennsylvania,
“Music and the Comrade Arts,” “Highways and By-ways of Music,” and
several excellent theoretical works; <b>O. B. Boise</b>, Peabody
Conservatory of Baltimore, with a work of a historical and critical
nature, “Music and Its Masters,” and some theoretical works; <b>Rupert
Hughes</b>, “Contemporary American Composers.

<h2>LESSON LX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle"><span class="smcap">Musical Education</span></span>.</h2>
<p><b>Early Musical Education</b>.—The training of students in music has
been the special care of the greatest men connected with the art, a
subject close to the heart of men of rank and of means, and the object
of Governmental and municipal subvention. In most of the countries and
many of the larger cities of Europe, Art is considered a legitimate
object for public aid and fostering, and music receives a fair share of
funds set aside for that purpose. In the period before the Christian
Era, musical education was carried on to prepare singers and players
either for the religious service, and in the hands of the priests,
or for entertainment and by slaves. Pope Sylvester founded a school
for singers, at Rome, in the 4th century, and the Church all through
its history has laid stress on means for training executants for its
musical services. Guido of Arezzo, credited with a number of reforms in
the teaching of vocal music, is said to have had a school for training
singers to read musical notation. Like him, many of his successors in
prominence were in charge of classes of pupils, yet this method by no
means accords with our ideas of systematic, logical education in music.
It was largely the personal power and eminence of the master that
attracted and retained pupils.</p>
<p><b>Musical Education in Italy</b>.—The first examples of the founding
of schools of music or conservatories take us to Italy. The noted
theorist Tinctor or Tinctoris started a school at <b>Naples</b>, in
1496, but this did not last very long. In the early part of the 16th
century, several institutions were founded by private contribution for
the purpose of affording homes and instruction to orphaned children.
Ecclesiastical music was at first the special object of these schools.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
The pupils sang in choirs, various religious offices, processions,
etc. There were four of these institutions: <i>Santa Maria di Loreto</i>,
founded in 1535, which had on its roster such eminent musicians as
Alessandro Scarlatti, Durante, Porpora, Sacchini and Guglielmi; <i>San
Onofrio</i>, founded in 1576, some famous pupils being Gizzi, Jommelli,
Piccini and Paisiello; <i>De Poveri di Gesù Cristo</i>, established in 1589,
numbering among its pupils, Greco, Vinci, and Pergolesi; <i>Della Pietà
de’ Turchini</i>, started in 1584, having among its pupils, Leo, Cafara,
and Feo. In 1797, the first two named were united, the third was
changed into a seminary for priests in 1744, and in 1808, the last was
closed, and a school of music was established to take the place of the
remaining institutions. This school, which received the title <i>Reale
Collegio di Musica</i>, still exists.</p>
<p><b>Venice</b> rivaled Naples in devotion to music, and early took
measures to give musical instruction to the wards of charitable
institutions. These schools were not named <i>Conservatorio</i>, as at
Naples, but <i>Ospedale</i> (hospital), since they were a part of the
foundation for institutions to receive the poor and infirm, their work
as conservatories developing gradually. Such masters as Lotti, Galuppi,
Scarlatti, Cimarosa presided over the four schools best known. When the
Republic fell, these institutions collapsed in the financial crisis
that followed. The principal music school in Venice at the present time
is the <i>Liceo Benedetto Marcello</i>, which is subsidized by the city.
An Italian conservatory of ancient date is the one at <b>Palermo</b>,
which was established in 1615. At the present time it is a State
institution. The Academy of St. Cecilia, at <b>Rome</b>, dates its
original foundation to a society of musicians formed in 1566, a charter
being granted by Pope Gregory XIII, in 1584. The Academy possesses the
largest and most important musical library in Italy. <b>Milan</b> had a
school of music as early as 1483. The celebrated theoretician, Gafurio,
was the first great teacher. It was not permanent, however, and though
there were schools for singers there from time to time, it was not
until 1807 that the municipality established a regular school of music.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
The first school of music at <b>Bologna</b> was established in 1482,
but it did not become permanent. In later years, musical affairs were
in the hands of academies for the promotion of arts and sciences. In
1864, a school was opened on modern lines. <b>Genoa</b> has a school
which was founded in 1829; it is subsidized by the city. The school at
<b>Florence</b> was opened in 1862, and is richly endowed. A school was
heavily endowed by Rossini and located at <b>Pesaro</b>, his birthplace.</p>
<p><b>The Paris Conservatoire</b>.—To France belongs the honor of
following closely in the footsteps of the Italian authorities. In
1784, a Royal School of Singing was opened in <b>Paris</b>, under
the direction of Gossec, the composer; in 1793 it was enlarged in
scope and was called the National Institute of Music; in 1795 the
name was changed to the <i>Conservatoire de Musique</i>, which it still
bears. In 1800 the organization was further modified by Bonaparte.
The institution receives an annual subvention from the Government.
This school is justly considered as one of the greatest in existence
and has been the centre of musical training for practically all the
prominent French musicians. A great incentive is the celebrated <i>Prix
de Rome</i> (Roman Prize), which enables the winner to spend three years
in study in Italy and Germany. The library is one of the most important
in France, and dates from the foundation of the school. The Museum,
which has one of the finest collections in Europe, was established in
1864. Affiliated schools have been established in the principal French
cities, such as: <b>Marseilles</b>, <b>Toulouse</b>, <b>Nantes</b>,
<b>Dijon</b>, <b>Lyons</b> and <b>Rouen</b>.</p>
<p><b>Musical Education in Germany</b>.—Among the German conservatories,
that at <b>Prague</b> is the oldest. It was founded in 1811. Besides
music, the course of study provides for instruction in general
branches. The violin department of this school is one of its strongest
features. The conservatory at <b>Vienna</b> was opened in 1817, under
the direction of Salieri, as a vocal school; other branches were added
and by 1821 the foundation was that of a true conservatory. The course
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
of study is comprehensive and the school has graduated a number
of eminent musicians. It is under the patronage of the Society of
the Friends of Music. Probably the German conservatory best known
to American readers is that founded at <b>Leipzig</b>, in 1843, by
Mendelssohn, and of which he was the first director. The fund used
in starting the school was one of 20,000 thalers bequeathed by a
Government official “for the purposes of art and science.” Such masters
as Schumann, Moscheles, Ferdinand David, Plaidy, Richter and Reinecke
were members of the faculty at different periods in the history of
the school. This conservatory has had a larger number of American
pupils than any other German institution. The oldest conservatory in
<b>Berlin</b> was a private institution. The most important school is
the Royal High School for Music, which is a branch of the Royal Academy
of Arts, and is under the patronage of the Prussian Government. This
school has three sections, the one for church music was opened in 1822,
for musical composition in 1833, that for executive art in 1869. The
violin school, under the direction of Joseph Joachim, attracts pupils
from all parts of the world. <b>Cologne</b> has a conservatory which is
aided financially by the municipality. This school was established in
1850, Ferdinand Hiller being the first director. The Royal Conservatory
at <b>Dresden</b> was organized in 1856, and has paid considerable
attention to its department for opera. <b>Munich</b> has a school
which receives State aid. It was founded in 1867. Rheinberger, who was
teacher of composition here, drew a number of Americans to the school.
Other schools receiving State or municipal subventions are those at
<b>Wuerzburg</b>, <b>Weimar</b>, <b>Frankfort</b> and <b>Wiesbaden</b>.</p>
<p><b>Other European Music Schools</b>.—The other European countries
have also promoted the organization of schools for teaching music.
The strongest schools in Switzerland are those at <b>Zurich</b>,
<b>Geneva</b>, <b>Basle</b> and <b>Berne</b>. In Belgium are several
fine schools: at <b>Brussels</b>, founded in 1813, which is now a
Government institution, at <b>Liége</b> (1827), at <b>Ghent</b> (1833),
and at <b>Antwerp</b>, the latter founded in 1867, by the noted Belgian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
composer, Peter Benoit. These four schools receive State aid. Holland
has three conservatories in her three large cities, <b>Amsterdam</b>,
<b>Rotterdam</b> and <b>The Hague</b>. Scandinavian musical education
is cared for by the conservatories at <b>Copenhagen</b>, <b>Christiania</b>
and <b>Stockholm</b>, the last being under Government patronage.
Spain has conservatories at <b>Madrid</b>, <b>Saragossa</b> and
<b>Valencia</b>, and Portugal, one at <b>Lisbon</b>. Greece sustains a
school at <b>Athens</b>.</p>
<p><b>St. Petersburg Conservatory</b>.—A conservatory of great importance
is that founded at <b>St. Petersburg</b> through the exertions of the
famous composer, Anton Rubinstein. In 1859, he organized the Russian
Musical Society, the first object of which was to give amateurs an
opportunity to practice orchestral playing. Changes in the policy of
the Society were gradually introduced, branches were founded in several
other cities, among them Moscow, and serious efforts were inaugurated
to organize a music school in the Capital. The first instruction was
given gratuitously, money was raised in private circles and a floor
was rented in a private house in 1862 for the use of the school. The
Emperor Alexander II gave to the school an annuity of 5000 rubles and
a building which was the property of the Crown. In 1866 the name was
officially designated as Conservatory, and from that time on several
members of the Royal family became patrons of the school, socially as
well as financially. Rubinstein was the first director. The building
at present occupied by the school was formerly the Grand Theatre and
is very completely furnished for the purposes of the Conservatory,
having two concert halls, museums, library, class rooms, chapel, etc.
Among the graduates of the institution are Tchaikovsky, Glazounoff,
Balakireff, Arensky, Liadow, Gabrilowitsch, Sapellnikoff and Felix Blumenfeld.</p>
<p><b>Musical Education in England</b> is well cared for, principally by
the strong schools in London, of which there are four that call for
particular notice. <b>The Royal Academy of Music</b> is the oldest; it
was founded in 1822. This institution has had royal patronage from the
beginning. The British public has generously replied with subscriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
to appeals made for funds at different periods in the history of the
school, the Government grant being revoked on several occasions. At
the present time the revenues are a Government grant, subscriptions,
donations, and students’ fees. Such eminent musicians as Dr. Crotch,
Sterndale Bennett and Sir George Macfarren have filled the position of
principal of the school. Sir A. C. Mackensie is the present head. A
strong rival to the Royal Academy is the <b>Royal College of Music</b>,
which is the outgrowth of the National Training School for Music,
founded by the Society of Arts in 1876, Sir Arthur Sullivan, first
principal. It was in 1883 that the institution passed into the hands of
the newly-organized Royal College of Music. The funds of the college
come from fees, subscriptions and endowments. Sir George Grove was
director for a number of years and was succeeded by Sir C. H. Hubert
Parry, the eminent composer and theorist. <b>Trinity College</b> is
the outgrowth of the activity of a musical society formed to promote
church music and singing. In 1881 it was incorporated under the name it
now bears and the scope of its instruction extended. The <b>Guildhall
School of Music</b> is under the patronage of the authorities of the
City of London. This institution was founded in 1880, and has a very
large attendance. The present director is Mr. W. H. Cummings. The
leading English universities, Cambridge, Oxford, London, Durham, and
that at Edinburgh and Dublin have courses in the theory of music,
leading to degrees.</p>
<p><b>Musical Education in the United States: Boston</b>.—The United
States has no schools of music under Governmental or municipal
direction, and none which receive subventions, and but one, established
in 1905, in New York City, which is endowed. The spread of musical
education has been due to the energies and in many cases the sacrifices
of musicians and music lovers in the larger cities. In Lesson LVII
reference was made to societies in the three large American cities,
Boston, New York and Philadelphia, to further musical education. The
oldest true music school in the United States is the <b>New England
Conservatory of Music</b>, in Boston, founded by Dr. Tourjée, in 1867.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
A notable feature was the dormitory for female students. Eminent
instructors were engaged, both foreigners and Americans, and the school
quickly established a reputation as the leading institution for musical
education. Dr. Tourjée was succeeded in the directorship by Mr. Carl
Faelten, who resigned after several years of service and was followed
in the office by Mr. George W. Chadwick, the present director, in 1897.
In 1902 a new building was erected largely through the benefactions
of several public-spirited citizens of Boston. Among the teachers who
exerted a strong influence on American pupils may be mentioned Stephen
A. Emery, A. D. Turner, Lyman W. Wheeler, Carlyle Petersilea, Otto
Bendix and George E. Whiting. A school in Boston, with special strength
in the violin department, was the Boston Conservatory, founded by Julius Eichberg.</p>
<p><b>The West</b>.—In 1878, several music-loving citizens of Cincinnati
established the <b>Cincinnati College of Music</b>, with Theodore
Thomas as the first director. After him came various members of the
faculty, and in 1897, Mr. Frank Van der Stucken accepted the post
of dean of the faculty. In connection with the Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra and the Festival Association, the College of Music has been
a powerful factor in the musical life of the city. As an educational
force it has done much for music in the West and the Southwest, and its
pupils have carried into all sections of the tributary States sound
musical precepts. <b>Chicago</b> has, at the present day, several
schools, organized and conducted by private enterprise, which are doing
splendid work and have made the city the musical centre of the West.
Musicians of the highest rank have been brought to the United States
by several of these conservatories, to the benefit of musical art in
Chicago and the Western States.</p>
<p><b>Oberlin Conservatory of Music</b>, a department of Oberlin College,
may be taken as a type of the American idea of musical work in an
institution of learning. The school has a strong faculty and a large
number of pupils, whose work receives credit for graduation in the
college courses; the students in music have all the privileges of those
entered in the regular colleges. Oberlin has been a great factor for
musical progress in the Middle West.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The East</b>.—New York City has two schools that deserve mention:
the <b>National Conservatory of Music</b>, founded by Mrs. Jeannette
Thurber, a school which has offered as teachers to the American pupils
such musicians as Rafael Joseffy and Antonin Dvořák; the <b>Institute
of Musical Art</b>, opened in 1905, with Frank Damrosch as director,
with a faculty of high repute, both Europeans and Americans. This
school started with an endowment of $500,000 given by Mr. James Loeb,
a New York banker. A school of music managed on conservative lines has
existed for a number of years in <b>Baltimore</b>, in connection with
the Peabody Institute, which was endowed by the banker, George Peabody.
At the present time nearly every city of importance in the United
States contains one or more conservatories, managed on a strictly
business basis, and furnishing to the people of their communities
thorough instruction at reasonable cost.</p>

<b>In the Colleges</b>.—The important American institutions for higher
education, both for men and for women, have recognized the claim of
music to a place in the curriculum, and have provision for instructions
in the theory, history and esthetics of music, many also having
facilities for instructions in the practical side of music. <b>Harvard</b>,
<b>Yale</b>, <b>Columbia</b>, <b>Pennsylvania</b>, <b>Michigan</b>,
<b>California</b> and <b>Northwestern</b> Universities have established
professorships of music, and have called eminent musicians to the posts.
The work done in hundreds of schools of less reputation is a great
factor in spreading musical culture throughout the country.

Maspéro, the Egyptologist, says that after the tomb has
been sealed, the family and guests return to the house of the deceased,
to a banquet, after which the “last link which holds the dead to the
family is broken. The sacred harpist plays a prelude, then, standing
before a statue of the deceased, chants the dirge first sung long ago
at the funeral of the Pharaoh Antouf: ‘The world is but perpetual
movement and change.... Not all the lamentations in the world will
restore happiness to the man who is in the sepulchre; make then a
good-day and do not be idle in enjoying thyself.’”</p></div>

By this is meant that all intervals of the major second,
so-called, are not equally large and cannot be, if a correct division
of fourths and fifths be desired. Didymus made the interval from C to
D smaller than the other seconds of the scale; Ptolemy put the “minor”
tone between D and E, where it is now placed.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
